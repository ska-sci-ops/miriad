.SH DESCRIPTION
IMBIN bins up (averages) pixels, and/or picks out every Nth
pixel, in some combination of the first three dimensions of an
image.  If the selected binning size does not integrally fit
into the size of the axis, the region is adjusted so that it
does if possible.
.sp
An output pixel is blanked only if there were no valid
contributing input pixels.

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
\fIin\fP
Input image.  Wild card expansion supported.  No default.
.TP
\fIregion\fP
Standard region of interest.  See the help on "region" for
more information.  The default is the entire input.
.TP
\fIbin\fP
A pair of values for each axis.  These give the spatial
increment and binning size in pixels for each axis to be applied
to the selected region.  If the binning size is not unity, it
must equal the increment.  For example, to bin up the image by 2
pixels in the x direction, and to pick out every third pixel in
the z direction, set BIN=2,2, 1,1, 3,1
Defaults are 1,1 for each axis.
.TP
\fIout\fP
Output image
.TP
\fIoptions\fP
Extra processing options.  Only the minimum characters to avoid
ambiguity is needed.
.nf
  sum       Produce sum rather than average of pixels in
            each bin
