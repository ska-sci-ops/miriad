.TH antconv 1
.SH NAME
antconv - convert baseline corrections into antenna corrections
.SH PERSON RESPONSIBLE
pjt
.SH CATEGORIES
calibration, utility
.SH DESCRIPTION
ANTCONV converts baseline corrections, as they
come from the Hat Creek Observatory (mostly Rick Forster),
to antenna based corrections which can be used in uvedit to
correct your beautiful data. See also UVEDIT.

Example of Correction text file:
.nf
     (Delta BL1-2 X)  (Delta BL1-2 Y) (Delta BL1-2 Z)
     (Delta BL1-3 X)  (Delta BL1-3 Y) (Delta BL1-3 Z)
         ....            ....           ....
     (Delta BL1-n X)  (Delta BL1-n Y) (Delta BL1-n Z)

.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
\fIin\fP
Name of the input text file containing the baseline corrections for
baselines involving antenna 1 and each other antenna in the array.
Note the delta baselines must be 1-n, NOT n-1; so delta baseline
values for baseline 3-1 must be negated to be delta baselines for
baseline 1-3.
The baseline corrections are expected in units of nanoseconds and
in an f9.6 format (OR separated by commas).
No default.
.TP
\fInants\fP
Number of antennas.  Default: 3
NOTE: Currently you should not (have to) change this
in our 3-element array. Maximum antennas possible is 9.
.TP
\fIrefant\fP
Reference antenna for new positions. Currently this can ONLY be
1, which is the default.
Default: refant=1
