.SH DESCRIPTION
VELSW is a Miriad task used to change the type of a spectral
axis.  For example, a frequency axis could be changed to
redshift or relativistic velocity.
.sp
The resulting axis may be non-linear.  If so, it will be marked
by a code, e.g. VOPT-F2W, meaning that it is actually linear in
frequency (F) but is labelled as a spectral type that is linear
in wavelength (W).  Such non-linear axes are handled properly by
the coordinate routines.  However, when plotted, non-linear axes
are only correct to first-order at the reference point.
.sp
Switching between velocity and other spectral types, via the
Doppler formula, is only possible if a rest frequency is
recorded in the header.  It is also possible to change the
Doppler reference frame to barycentric or LSRK (only).
.sp
Note that velocity axes labelled as {VELO,FELO}-{HEL,LSR} in
Miriad have been Doppler-shifted to the specified frame
(barycentric or LSRK) as would be expected.  However, frequency
axes labelled as FREQ-{HEL,LSR} are actually topocentric, the
Doppler frame here refers only to the value of vobs recorded in
the header.  This convention also applies to FITS images written
and read by Miriad - the presence of vobs with FREQ-{HEL,LSR} in
the header of a Miriad image read from such a FITS file is
indicative.  However, there is a potential inconsistency when
FITS files generated by other packages are read into Miriad.
See option altspc below.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
\fIin\fP
Name of the input image data set.  No default.
.TP
\fIaxis\fP
The spectral type to change to:
.nf
  FREQ: frequency,
  ENER: photon energy (linear with frequency),
  WAVN: wavenumber (linear with frequency),
  VRAD: radio velocity (linear with frequency),
  WAVE: wavelength,
  VOPT: optical velocity (linear with wavelength),
  ZOPT: redshift (linear with wavelength),
  AWAV: air wavelength (applicable to optical regime only),
  VELO: apparent radial velocity (relativistic),
  BETA: relativistic beta factor (= VELO/c).
.fi
.sp
Note that there is no minimum-match on these four-letter
spectral types.  For backwards compatibility, 'frequency',
'radio', and 'optical' (with min-match) are understood as
synonyms for 'FREQ', 'VRAD', and 'VOPT'.
.sp
AIPS-convention types, {FREQ,VELO,FELO}-{HEL,LSR}, are also
understood and will be translated.  Here VELO means radio
velocity (VRAD), and FELO is optical velocity (VOPT-F2W).
However, these types are deprecated, and there is no way to
switch to them explicitly.
.sp
An optional second value defines the Doppler frame to transform
to (min-match applies):
.nf
  BARYCENT: Solar System barycentre (aka BARYCENT{RE,ER,RIC},
            or HEL),
      LSRK: Kinematic Local Standard of Rest.
.fi
.sp
The default for both the spectral type and the Doppler frame is
to leave them as is, performing only required translations.
.TP
\fIoptions\fP
Extra processing options.
.nf
  altspc    Force FREQ-{HEL,LSR} axes to be interpreted as
            barycentric or LSRK (rather than topocentric - see
            above).  Since vobs will normally be absent from
            the Miriad header of images read from FITS files
            generated by other packages (such as Livedata), it
            should not normally be necessary to use this option.
            However, it will not hurt.  Thus, running
.fi
.sp
.nf
               velsw in=<infile>
.fi
.sp
.nf
            should be enough to fix such headers; ctype and
            specsys would be relabelled while leaving crval and
            cdelt unchanged.
