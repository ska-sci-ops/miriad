.SH NAME
moslst - LST coverage of the different pointings in a mosaic.
.SH PERSON RESPONSIBLE
rjs
.SH CATEGORIES
uv analysis
.SH DESCRIPTION
Determine the LSTs at which particular fields in a mosaic
run are observed.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
\fIvis\fP
Input vis datasets. No default.
.TP
\fIfields\fP
Indices of the pointings to check. If nothing is given, all
pointings are checked.
.TP
\fIsource\fP
Base source name of the mosaic. By default, MOSLST assumes that
any source whose names ends in digits is a pointing of a mosaic,
and takes this digits as the pointing number. If the SOURCE parameter
is given, then MOSLST takes only those sources starting with that
name, ending in digits, and with a possible underscore character
in between.
.TP
\fIdevice\fP
PGPLOT device for the LST ranges. The default is no plot.
.TP
\fIppp\fP
"Pointings per plot". This is used for plotting, and allows the
output to be broken into a number of subplots. Each subplot will
have (at most) the given number of pointings in it. The default
is to not break it into subplots.
.TP
\fIlog\fP
Output log file. Default is the terminal.
.TP
\fIgap\fP
Gap tolerance. This is used for the log output to indicate
large gaps in the LST coverage. The default is 36 minutes.
