.SH DESCRIPTION
doc2man is a tool that formats a MIRIAD .doc file into an even less
readable form: the unix man format. However, with X windows utilities
like xman or hman, a much more superior online help system is created.
Within miriad a script 'mir.man' or alias 'mirman' should be present
to aid in starting up a windows based man browser.
Optionally a section number can be passed to the output man file.
