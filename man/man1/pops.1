.SH DESCRIPTION
POPS is a Miriad task which converts equatorial positions
from one epoch to another. Accuracy is about 1 arcsec.
If an observatory is also given, POPS
gives other source information, such as radial velocity, source
rise and set time and source elevation and azimuth.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
\fIradec\fP
Right ascension and declination, given as hh:mm:ss,dd:mm:ss.
These coordinates are assumed to be mean coordinates of the given
epoch. The mean, true and apparent coordinates are printed on output.
.TP
\fIepochs\fP
The input and output epochs. The epochs can be given as either
Bxxxx or Jxxxx (where xxxx is a year, e.g. B1950 or J2000), or as
yymmmdd:hh:mm:ss, a time in normal Miriad format
(e.g. 93JAN05:10:25:00).
.TP
\fItelescop\fP
Observatory name. Default is the geocenter.
