.SH DESCRIPTION
TVALL is a WERONG/MIRIAD task which allows interactive
modification of the TV lookup tables, etc. Usually this would be
used to manipulate an image previously loaded with TVDISP.
A menu for operations
to be performed will appear on the TV screen. The following are
possible:
.sp
Choose the channel being displayed (Select the channel number
from the menu).
.sp
Blink between two channels (The mouse y-coordinate determines
the blink rate. It blinks between the current and succeeding
image, mod 3. Hit any button to stop blinking).
.sp
Fiddle the lookup tables (The transfer function is governed by
the mouse position. Hit any button to finish the command).
.sp
Change the lookup tables between black and white, or colour.
.sp
Zoom and pan (the left button zooms in, the middle button zooms
out, and the mouse position controls pan. The cursor drawn on
the IVAS gives the position, on the unzoomed screen, of the
central pixel currently being displayed. To finish, hit the
right button.).
.sp
Switch the menu off (by `selecting' the asterisk). This is
useful if you want to take a photograph of the screen.
.sp
Return cursor position. The coordinates given are coordinates
(not image coordinates).
