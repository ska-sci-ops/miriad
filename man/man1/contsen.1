.TH contsen 1
.SH NAME
contsen - Continuum subtraction noise sensitivity.
.SH PERSON RESPONSIBLE
rjs
.SH CATEGORIES
uv analysis
.SH DESCRIPTION
CONTSEN makes plots of noise amplification factor of tasks such
as UVLIN, AVMATHS and CONTSUB.
.SH PARAMETERS
.TP
\fIchans\fP
This specifices the channel ranges that contain only continuum
(line free). It consists of a number of paris, each pair giving
a start and end channel. The default is that there are 512
continuum channels.
.TP
\fIxrange\fP
The range of channels to plot the noise sensitivity. The default
is the min anx max channels given by the chans keyword.
.TP
\fIorder\fP
The order of the polynomial fit in UVLIN. Either 1 or 2 numbers
can be given. If two numbers are given, then CONTSEN determines
the noise sensitivity for order(1) to order(2) inclusive. The
default is to determine the noise sensitivity for first order
only.
.TP
\fIdevice\fP
PGPLOT device. No default.
.TP
\fInxy\fP
The plot grid. The default depends on the number of plots.
