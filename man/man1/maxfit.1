.SH DESCRIPTION
MAXFIT finds the maximum value of a region of an image.
This region may be three dimensional.  It then fits a
parabola to a 3x3 array extracted from the first two
dimensions of the image and centred on the maximum pixel
in the specified region.  MAXFIT then returns the location
and value of the maximum pixel and the fitted pixel.
