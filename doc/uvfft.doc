%N uvfft
%D Fourier transform a sequence of selected uv-data.
%P mchw
%: uv analysis
%B
        UVFFT takes a 1-D Fourier transform of a uv-data sequence.
        If the sequence is a time series, then the FFT is a fringe
        rate spectrum. If the sequence steps the delay center, then
        the FFT is a bandpass.
%A vis
        The input UV dataset name. No default.
%A select
        This selects the data to be processed, using the standard uvselect
        format. Default is all data. Selecting more than one baseline
        does not make much sense.
%A line
        Standard linetype of data to be tranformed, in the form:
          type,nchan,start,width,step
        where type can be `channel'  `wide' or `velocity'.
        The default is wide,2,1,1,1. The maximum number of channels
        which can be processed is 8.
%A size
        The length of the sequence for the Fourier transform.
        uv-data points in excess of the size of the transform are omitted.
        Must be a power of 2. The default is 128.
%A log
        The list output file name. The default is the terminal.
%A device
        standard PGPLOT device, e.g. /xw
%A delay
        Step size for stepped delay center. FFT is bandpass function.
        Default=0  Delay center not stepped. FFT is fringe frequency spectrum.
        processing options:
          test - substitute test functions for data into Fourier transform.
