        MOSCSDI is a MIRIAD task that performs a Complex Steer CLEAN on
        mosaiced Q and U images or cubes. This follows the CSDI MIRIAD task,
        but adapted for a mosaic, see the help for this task for more
        information.
 
        Full details of the algorithm are found in:
        Pratley & Johnston-Hollitt, "An improved method for polarimetric
        image restoration in interferometry", MNRAS, 2016. ArXiv: 1606.01482.
        Please acknowledge this work in publications using the code.
 
%A map
        The input Q and U dirty map, which should have units of Jy/beam
        No default.
%A beam
        The input dirty beam. No default
%A model
        An initial Q and U model of the deconvolved image.
        The default is 0.
%A out
        The name of the Q and U output map.
        The units of the output will be Jy/pixel.
%A gain
        CLEAN loop gain. The default is 0.1.
%A niters
        The maximum number of iterations. The default is 100.
%A cutoff
        Iterating stops if the absolute maximum residual falls below
        this level.  The default is 0. It is recommended that the
        cutoff is 3 times the rms noise of Stokes Q or U.
%A clip
        This sets the relative clip level.  Values are typically 0.75 to
        0.9.  The default is 0.9.
%A region
        The standard region of interest keyword.  See the help on
        "region" for more information. The default is the entire image.
