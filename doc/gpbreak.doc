%N gpbreak
%D Insert a break point in the gain table.
%P rjs
%: calibration
%B
        GpBreak is a MIRIAD task which modifies a gain table to include a
        break point. This prevents normal interpolation of gains across
        this point.
%A vis
        The input visibility file, containing the gain file to modify.
        No default.
%A break
        The times, in the normal Miriad format, where to insert the
        break point. Several times can be given. No default.
%A ants
        The antennas affected. The default is all antennas.
%A feeds
        The polarisation feeds affected (e.g. R, L, X or Y). Default is
        all feeds.
 
        Example:
          gpbreak vis=cyga times=20:30,21:15 ants=1,2 feeds=X
