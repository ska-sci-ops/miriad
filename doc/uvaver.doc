%N uvaver
%D Copy and average a uv dataset.
%P rjs
%: uv analysis
%B
        UVAVER copies a uv dataset, performing averaging, both in time
        and/or frequency.
%A vis
        The name of the input uv data sets. Several can be given (wild
        cards are supported). No default.
%A select
        The normal uv selection commands. The default is copy everything.
%A line
        The normal uv linetype in the form:
          line,nchan,start,width,step
        The default is all channels (or all wide channels if there are no
        spectral channels). The output will consist of only spectral or
        wideband data (but not both).
%A ref
        The normal reference linetype, in the form:
          line,start,width
        The default is no reference line.
%A stokes
        If a value is given, uvaver converts the input into the required
        polarizations before writing to the output. Default is to copy
        across the polarizations present in the input files.
%A interval
        Time averaging interval, in minutes. The default is 0 (i.e. no
        averaging).
%A options
        This gives extra processing options. Several options can be given,
        each separated by commas. They may be abbreivated to the minimum
        needed to avoid ambiguity. Possible options are:
           nocal       Do not apply the gains file. By default, UVAVER
                       applies the gains file in copying the data.
           nopass      Do not apply bandpass corrections. By default,
                       UVAVER corrects for the bandpass shape if the
                       required information is available.
           nopol       Do not apply polarizatiopn corrections. By default
                       UVAVER corrects for polarization corss-talk.
           relax       Normally UVAVER discards a correlation record if
                       all the correlations are bad. This option causes
                       UVAVER to retain all records.
           vector      Means do vector averaging.  This is the default.
           scalar      Means do scalar averaging for the amplitudes
                       and vector averaging for the phase.
           scavec      Means do scalar averaging for the amplitudes of
                       the  `parallel-hand' polarisations (i,xx,yy,rr,ll).
                       Vector averaging is used for the amplitudes of
                       the cross-hand visibilities (q,u,v,xy,yx,rl,lr)
                       and for the phases for all visibilities.
%A out
        The name of the output uv data set. No default.
