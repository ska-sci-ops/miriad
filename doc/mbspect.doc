%N mbspect
%D Make spectrum and measure velocities from a Miriad image.
%P lss
%: image analysis and display.
%B
        MBSPECT makes a spectrum of the velocity or frequency axis of
        a Miriad image.  The spectrum is integrated, averaged or beam-
        weighted, over the width specified, for the other image axes.
        Robust spectral baselines can be fitted, and the profile
        parameterised (velocities, widths, moments).  The output
        spectrum can be plotted and/or written out as a miriad and/or
        ascii file for further analysis.
%A in
        The input image. vxy and xyv images are acceptable inputs.
        No default.
%A out
        The output spectrum, if required.  Spectral units are always in
        the same units as the input file (even if a conversion is
        performed for the plot and/or log file).  This spectrum can be
        read back into MbSpect.
%A coord
        The position, in world coordinates, for which the spectrum is
        required, e.g. coord=12:00:13,-42:00:43.  The cube must have
        an RA and a DEC axis.  The pixel with the nearest position is
        chosen.  The default is the centre of the image (not necessarily
        the reference pixel).
%A width
        Two numbers, being the spatial width of the box in pixels (in RA
        and DEC) within which the spectrum is averaged (or integrated).
        Must be odd numbers.  Default is 1,1.
%A xaxis
        The x-axis can be plotted as 'channel', 'frequency' ('FREQ'),
        'radio' velocity ('VELO'), 'optical' velocity ('FELO'), or the
        units in the image.  The default is whatever units are in the
        header. A second value will overwrite the default label for this
        axis. You can use pgplot escape characters to change fonts
        and sub/superscript level, e.g.,
        'Optical Velocity, \ficz\fr km\u-1s\d' will write 'cz' in
         italics and '-1' as a superscript.
%A yaxis
        If 'average' then the pixels enclosed in the x-y area specified
        are averaged.  If 'sum' they are summed and normalized if the
        units are known.  If 'point' they are optimally weighted
        according to the beam parameters, assuming that the source is
        unresolved.  Default is 'average'. A second value will overwrite
        the default label for this axis.
%A xrange
        X-axis range for plot.  The default is to self-scale to the
        region requested.  The units are km/s for velocity and MHz for
        frequency (i.e. not the normal miriad convention).
%A yrange
        Y-axis range for plot.  The default is to self-scale.
%A hann
        Hanning smoothing length (an odd integer < 15).  The default is
        no smoothing (hann = 1).
%A order
        Order of optional robust (clipped polynomial) fit (0-10) to be
        applied to the spectral axis.  If the order is positive (0 to
        10), the fit is plotted on top of the data; if negative (-0 to
        -10), the fit is subtracted before plotting.  The fit is always
        subtracted from any output data written.  (For bulk removal of
        baselines in a cube, use contsub).  Default is no fit.
%A options
        List of minimum match task enrichment options.
        1deriv  Take 1-sided derivative of spectrum before plotting
                and after Hanning smoothing.  Useful for Zeeman
                enthusiasts.
        2deriv  Take 2-sided derivative of spectrum before plotting.
        histo   Plot the spectrum as a histogram instead of joining
                points.
        pstyle1 Alternative plot style, where the object and position
                information is omitted and the comment field is centered
                at the top of the plot. Typically, this is used for
                publication-quality plots (the source name, if required.
                should be inserted into the comment field).
        pstyle2 Alternative plot style, where the object and position
                information is omitted, the comment field is centered
                at the top of the plot (as with options=pstyle1), and
                the x and y axis labels are omitted. Typically, this is
                used to generate publication-quality n x m matrix plots
                (the source name, if required should be inserted into
                the comment field).
        posfit  If width > 1, a source position is estimated from a
                Gaussian fit to the moment map.  The moment map is
                formed using the velocity range specified by the profile
                parameter.  If yaxis = point, this new position is used
                when forming the spectrum (the region set by the initial
                coord parameter and the width parameter is not changed).
        measure Measure various spectral parameters on plotted spectrum.
                If a profile window is set, the line is only measured
                within this window.  If the order keyword is used, the
                fit is always subtracted before spectral fitting.  If a
                plot device is selected, the width-maximised 50% and 20%
                points are highlighted with a circle and the width-
                minimised points are highlighted with a cross.  Zeroth
                moment (profile area), first moment (mean velocity/
                frequency/channel) and second moment (dispersion) are
                calculated in the usual way.  These parameters are not
                robust unless careful use of the profile and clip
                parameters is made.  However, more robust moment-like
                parameters are also calculated by using an algorithm
                that minimises the mean absolute deviation of the flux-
                weighted velocities.
       minicube If an output file is selected (out parameter selected),
                a 3x3 mincube is produced.  No extra spatial information
                is available; the extra spatial dimensions just
                duplicate spectral information in the central pixel.
                Useful for tasks such as regrid that only work with
                cubes whose dimensions are not unity.
%A clip
        Two values.  Exclude pixels with values in the range clip(1) to
        clip(2).  If only one value is given, then exclude -abs(clip) to
        abs(clip).
%A mask
        This specifies the x-axis ranges to be excluded from any
        continuum fit, e.g. those containing line emission.  It consists
        of a number of pairs, each pair giving a start and end x-value.
        The default is that all channels are line-free, which is quite a
        good approximation if the line is weak compared to the
        continuum.  The units of the x-axis values are the same as given
        by the xaxis keyword.
%A profile
        Two values.  This specifies the x-axis range to be included for
        profile measurement (options=measure).  It consists of a start
        and end x-value.  The default is that all channels are used for
        profile measurement.  For weak lines, you will normally need to
        set a profile window, a mask window a clip level, or any
        combination of the above.  The profile and mask windows may be
        the same, although the profile window is limited to a single
        pair of values.  The units of the x-axis values are the same as
        given by the xaxis keyword.
%A device
        Standard PGPLOT device.  See the help on "device" for more
        information.
%A csize
        Up to 2 values.  Character sizes in units of the PGPLOT default
        (which is ~ 1/40 of the view surface height) for the plot axis
        labels and the title.
        Defaults try to choose something sensible.  Use 0.0 to default
        any particular value.
%A lines
        Up to 2 values. Line widths for the axes and the plot.
        Defaults to 1,1.
%A colors
        Up to 3 values. Colors for the main spectrum, the polynomial
        fit and the 'measure' parameters. Defaults to 1,2,3
%A log
        Write spectrum to this ascii file. Spectral axis units are as
        specified by the xaxis keyword. Default is no output file.
%A comment
        A one-line comment which is written into the logfile and any
        plot. If the comment contains spaces you need to enclose it
        in single quotes.

  and ps output can be piped.
