%N uvfstats
%D Print flagging statistics.
%P rjs
%: calibration
%B
        UVFSTATS prints statistics about flagged visibilities.
 
%A vis
        Input visibility file. Several can be given. Wildcards are
        supported. No default.
%A line
        Normal line parameter. The default is all channels.
%A select
        Normal visibility selection parameter. The default is to select
        all visibilities.
%A mode
        This determines what the flagging statitics are determined as
        a function of. Possible values are:
          stokes    Determine statistics by Stokes/pol'n parameter.
                    This is the default.
          overall   Give a single overall statistic.
          baseline  Determine statistics by baseline number.
          antenna   Determine statistics by antenna number.
          channel   Determine statistics by channel number.
%A options
        Task enrichment parameters. Possible values are
          absolute  Give flagged correlations as an absolute number
                    rather than a percentage.
          unflagged Give statistics about the unflagged (rather than
                    flagged) correlations.
