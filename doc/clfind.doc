   CLFIND is a MIRIAD task which finds the clumps in a 3-d cube,
   by tracing contours, proceeding to lower levels and following
   merging of said clumps. For full description/testing/application in

%A in
      The input image containing the data cube.  (No default)
      The output clump assignment file (also a miriad datacube
      with the same dimensions as the input) has the name "in".cf
 
%A dt
      The contour increment (no default)
 
%A start
      The starting contour level (default=1)
 
%A nmin
      Minimum number of pixels in each clump.
      Any clumps with fewer pixels are rejected (default=4).
