%N uvputhd
%D Allows user to alter values of header variables in uv dataset
%P lgm
%: vis,uv,header
%B
     UVPUTHD allows the user to change the values of uv variables in a
     uv dataset. All occurances of the variable are changed to the
     new value. If the variable is an array, all new values must be
     entered in sequential order. If the user desires to set all members
     of an array to a single value, only one value need be entered.
     Values can also be inserted from a time ordered table.
     Note: PUTHD must be used to use the uv override principle, but
     can only be used for single items, i.e. uv variables which are
     not an array.
%A vis
     Name of the input MIRIAD dataset. Only one dataset is allowed.
     No default.
%A hdvar
     Name of header variable to be changed. Refer to user manual or
     run VARLIST to see the selection of allowed variable names.
     No default.
%A type
     Type of variable, either integer (i),real (r), double precision (d),
     or ascii (a). Unused if variable already exists in the data file.
     CAVEAT: Tables do not support ascii types yet.
     No Default.
%A length
     Length of array of variable values. Unused if variable already
     exists in data file or table is specified, else set to 1.
%A varval
     New values of header variable - if the variable is an array
     all values must be specified or will assume one value for all.
     If you want values that change with time, you must use the
     table= keyword instead.
     No default.
%A table
     Name of the table that lists time (fractional days since time0) in
     column 1, and the values of the array in columns 2 through LENGTH+1.
     Values are simply inserted as soon as the time has passed, no
     interpolation is performed (unless options=inter and the variable is
     real or double precision)
     CAVEAT: do not use array variables with tables, and type=ascii cannot
     be used either.
     No default.
%A time0
     Offset time as applied to the times in column 1 of the table for
     tabular input. Legal formats as defined in subroutine DAYJUL,
     of which the ISO standard "ccyy-mm-dd[Thh[:mm[:ss.s]]]" is to
     be preferred.
     Default: not used, in which case the offset is 0, in which case
     fractional days are really Julian Days.
%A options
     There is a single option
       inter - interpolate real and double precision values linearly
%A out
     Name of the output dataset. No default.
