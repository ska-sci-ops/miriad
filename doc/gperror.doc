        GPERROR is a Miriad task which adds a gains table to a uv dataset.
        This gain table consists of random phase and amplitude errors.
        GPERROR's use is in simulating such phase and amplitude errors in
        the data. See also UVGEN's GNOISE and PNOISE parameters.
%A vis
        The input visibility file. This is used to determine the number
        of antennas and the time range.
        No default.
%A interval
        Averaging time interval, over which variations will occur,
        in minutes.
        Default is 5.
%A pnoise
        Anntena based rms phase noise, in degrees.
        Default is 0.
%A gnoise
        Antenna based rms gain noise, given as a percentage.
        Default is 0.
