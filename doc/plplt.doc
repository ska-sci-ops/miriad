%D Plot the visibility function for a planet
%P rjs
%: uv analysis
%B
        PLPLOT plots the visibility function of a planet at a particular
        epoch. This models the planet as a spherical black body with
        some brightness temperature.
%A source
        This gives the name of a planet. No default.
%A epoch
        This gives the time of the observation, in Miriad's standard
        date format. No default.
%A device
        PGPLOT plotting device. No default.
%A freq
        Observing frequency, in GHz. The default is 22 GHz.
%A pltb
        The brightness temperature of the planet, in Kelvins.
        The default depends on the planet and the observing frequency.
%A uvrange
        The range of baseline lengths to plot over. The baseline
        length is given in metres. The default is 0 to 3000 metres.
