        SPECSHIFT shifts all spectra in a cube according to a 2-D
        template (a velocity field).  The velocity of the template is
        made the central pixel of the spectrum.  If the template is
        blanked or out-of-range the spectrum is unchanged.  Based on
        Bart Wakker's HANNING.
 
%A in
         The input data cube.  No default.
 
%A tin
         The template image, should be 2-D with same RA/DEC axes as the
         input cube.
 
%A out
         The output image.  No default.
 
%A region
         The region of the input cube to modify.  Default is the whole
         cube.
 
%A refpix
         The velocity pixel which will be assigned to the template
         velocity.  Default is the middle pixel of the v-range.
 
%A options
         doblank    Don't wrap profile around; blank if out of range.
                    By default the edge channels are assumed to be
                    noise so the profile is wrapped when shifting
                    beyond edges.
