        ITEMIZE is a MIRIAD task which dumps a dataset or an item within a
        dataset. If the input name is an item, then the contents of the
        item (element for element) are written to the screen. If the input
        name represents a dataset, then a summary of the items within the
        dataset are given.
%A in
        The name of either a dataset, or an item within a data set or a
        wildcard. For example:
          % itemize in=dataset
        or
          % itemize in=dataset/item
        or
          % itemize in='*'
        For example, to show the history information of file ``cm'', use
          % itemize in=cm/history
        When a dataset name is given, itemize summarizes the contents
        of the entire dataset. When an item name is also given, then
        itemize dumps the entire contents of the item (in accordance
        to the index and format keywords).
 
        Note that in ITEMIZE an "item" is one of the files in a MIRIAD
        data set directory, for example the 'history' item, shown above.
        To access the values of individual header items, use 'gethd'.
 
%A log
        The name of the output listing file. The default is the users
        terminal.
%A index
        When dumping an entire item, "index" specifies the range of elements
        to dump. The default is the entire item. For example, to print out
        lines 10 through 20 of the history item, use:
          % itemize in=cm/history index=10,20
%A format
        When dumping an entire item, this gives the FORTRAN format specifier
        to be used. For example, when dumping a real item, you may set:
          format=8e15.7
        The default varies according to the data type.
%A options
        Extra processing options. Several options can be given separated by
        commas. Minimum match is honoured.
          nocompact  Normally itemize does not print blocks of identical lines.
                     Instead it gives a message indicating the number of repetitions
                     of a line. The "nocompact" option causes it to print the
                     repetitions. This is useful if the output is being parsed
                     by other software.
