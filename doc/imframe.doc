%N imframe
%D Interchange axes of a cube and decrease/enlarge the frame
%P bpw
%: map manipulation
%B
   IMFRAME takes any part of an input cube, rotates it over any
   combination of 90 deg angles and writes the result anywhere in an
   output cube. This works on any cube whose longest axis is less than
   262144 pixels long.
   Note that IMFRAME does not resample images, only whole-pixel
   transformations are possible. See REGRID to resample/rotate in a more
   arbitrary way.
%A in
   The input image. No default.
%A region
   Standard keyword region. See the help on "region" for more information.
%A box
   Some subcommands of the region keyword work only nicely on 3-d cubes.
   This is too limited for imframe, so an alternative keyword is
   provided for other cases, which is less fancy than region= but it
   does the job.  The values to be given are a list of ranges for each
   coordinate axis, in relative pixel coordinates, in the order
     xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,...
   etc. c  Note that this is different from the standard region order
   xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax.
   The default is to take the whole cube. box= and region= are mutually
   exclusive.
%A out
   The output image. No default.
%A frame
   The size of the output dataset.  The values to be given are a list of
   ranges for each coordinate axis in relative pixel coordinates, in the
   order
     xmin,xmax,ymin,ymax,...
   etc. Note that this is different from the standard region order
   xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax. The defined frame may be bigger or smaller than
   the input box. The values refer to the axes in the original ordering.
   If not given, the input box is assumed (from either region= or box=,
   whichever one was given).
%A goal
   The new axis ordering in terms of the old axis ordering: i.e. 'zxy'
   makes the original 'z'-axis the 'x'-axis of the output. It is only
   necessary to give the axes that are changed, the other axes are
   concatenated to the list, i.e. 'z' would do just as well in the
   example above. The default is not to exchange axes. Precede an
   axisname with a - to reverse the direction.
