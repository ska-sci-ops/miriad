%N uvdflag
%D Flags a visibility dataset on uvdistance in klambda.

        UVZFLAG is a MIRIAD task which flags correlations in a
        visibility dataset the uvdistance is in a certain range.
        This task is needed because the standard uv select keyword
        only selects on the uv coordinates of the first channel.
%A vis
        The input visibility datasets to be flagged. No default. Several
        datasets can be given. Wildcards are supported.
%A select
        Normal visibility selection, which is applied to the template
        dataset. See the help on "select" for more information.
%A uvrange
        Two values, giving the range of uv distances in klambda to flag.
        A single value will flag all correlations with larger uv distance.
%A options
        Extra processing options. Several can be given, separated by
        commas. Minimum match is supported. Possible values are:
          noapply Do not apply the flagging, just report the statistics
                  about what would be flagged.
          invert  Invert the selection - flag correlations outside the
                  specified uvrange
