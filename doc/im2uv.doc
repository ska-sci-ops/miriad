%N im2uv
%D Convert an image to visibilities.
%P rjs
%: uv analysis
%B
        This Fourier transforms an image and writes the result as a
        visibility file.  Thus the uv plane sampling pattern is a
        cartesian grid.  Many of the uv variables are given reasonably
        arbitrary values to make the output dataset appear mildly
        sensible.
%A model
        Input image model. No default.  The model should have units of
        Jy/pixel, eg. a clean component model.  Only a two-dimensional
        model is handled.
%A out
        Output visibility dataset.  No default.
%A region
        The region of interest in the model.  The model is treated as
        zero outside the region of interest.  See the help on "region"
        for more information.
%A select
        Visibility data selection - only 'uvrange' selection is
        supported.  See the help on "select" for more information.
