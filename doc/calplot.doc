%B
        CALPLOT plots the flux of primary calibrators as a function
        of frequency.
%A source
        The source to be plotted. No default.
%A xrange
        This gives two numbers, being the frequency range to plot, in GHz.
        The default is 4.7,4.9.
%A stokes
        The Stokes parameters to be plotted. The default is to plot
        only I.
%A options
        "cursor"   This activates the cursor, and returns the flux density
          for each Stokes at the frequency specified by the x-location
          of the cursor. Use right button (or 'X') to exit.
%A device
        PGPLOT device. No default.
