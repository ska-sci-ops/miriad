        ZEEFAKE is a MIRIAD program to generate fake I and V cubes with
        Zeeman splitting.  Zero velocity is put at the centre of the
        band and image.  The cubes are output in VXY order ready for the
        ZEESTAT program.
 
%A iout
        The output Stokes I cube. No default.
 
%A iuout
        The output Stokes I cube in the case of no splitting.  Default
        is not to write this cube out.
 
%A vout
        The output Stokes V cube.  No default.
 
%A imsize
        The output cube sizes, all three dimensions required (VXY).
 
%A vinc
        The velocity increment along the cubes in km/s.  No default.
 
%A delv
        The Zeeman splitting (separation of split lines) in km/s.
        B < 0 if DELV > 0.  No default.
 
%A fwhm
        The FWHM of the Gaussian line profile in km/s.  No default.
 
%A grvc
        The velocity increment of the line centre in the x-direction
        per pixel (km/s).  Makes a linear ramp across the source.
 
%A grint
        Intensity increment in the x direction per pixel.  Makes
        a triangular weighting function.  Peak response is 1.0.
 
%A grfwhm
        FWHM increment in the x direction per pixel.  Makes
        a linear ramp across the source.
 
%A grsplit
        Splitting increment in the x direction.  Makes a linear ramp
        across the source.
 
%A theta
        The angle of the magnetic field to the line-of-sight in degrees.
        No default.
 
%A noise
        The RMS noise to be added to the RR and LL responses.  Note that
        the peak RR or LL response in this program is 1.0 for theta=0.
 
%A restfreq
        Line rest frequency in GHz.
 
%A type
        The line type - "e" for emission (default), "a" for absorption.
