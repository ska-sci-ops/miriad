        First calculates a Hermographic brightness temperature map,
        then uses interpolation and coordinate rotations to find
        the corresponding map in geocentric RA and DEC offsets from
        the sub-earth point.  Next, the Fresnel reflection coef-
        ficients are applied to obtain the model map.  Finally, a
        set of CLEAN components are generated for use in the RAL
        software package.  This is the non-linear diffusion version.
 
        $MIR/cat/hermes.in is a sample input file, and can be copied
