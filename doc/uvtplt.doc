%B
      UVTPLT plots Tsys for each field of a mosaiced observation
 
%A vis
        Input visibility file. No default.
%A freq
        Band centre frequencies of interest in MHz. No default.
%A source
        Root name of mosaiced field.  E.g. "cena_" with fields like

%A fields

%A device
        PGPLOT device.  No default.
%A nxy
        Number of plots in z and y directions per page
%A options
        tsysm  Get Tsys from median smoothed variables "xtsysm"
           and "ytsysm" rather than usual "xtsys" and "ytsys"
        first  Drop the first cycle of each new mosaic field
        median Draw the median Tsys curve on the plot as well.
           Options=first is done before the median is worked out.
 
%A size
        PGPLOT character size.
        Default is 1.0
