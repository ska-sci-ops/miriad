        UVIMAGE makes a Miriad image datacube of the uvdata in a
        Channel - Baseline - Time order.
        Missing Baselines are replaced with 0s,
        Missing channels cause a fatal error.
        Flagged data are shown as 0, even if underlying values are non-0
 
        This program expects the data to be homogeneous.
 
        Related tasks:
                TVFLAG - good for inspection and flagging, but
                         only works in 8bit displays
                UVAVER - use this to cut down the number of times
                VARMAP - image maps of uv-variables
%A vis
        The input uv-dataset name. No default.
%A select
        This selects which visibilities to be used. Default uses
        all the data. See the Users Guide for information about
        how to specify uv data selection.
        e.g. 'select=ant(1)(5),-time(00:00,01:09)'
%A line
        Linetype of the data in the format line,nchan,start,width,step
        "line" can be `channel', `wide' or `velocity'.
        Default is channel,0,1,1,1, which uses all the spectral
        channels.
 
%A view
        Visibility 'amplitude', 'phase', 'real', 'imaginary'
        No calibration is applied by UVIMAGE.
        Default: amplitude
 
%A out
        Output image. If no output image give, the visibility
        data will be scanned and a summary is given if there
        are integrations with missing (or extra) baselines
        and missing (or extra) channels.
        Currently the image cube is poorly labeled as
        CHANNEL, BASELINE, TIME with no real meaningful coordinates.
        See mode= below for other orderings of axes.
%A mode
        This controls in what order the cube is written
        1: CHANNEL-BASELINE-TIME (default)
        2: TIME-CHANNEL-BASELINE
        3: TIME-BASELINE-CHANNEL
%A options
        time : make time axis linear, leaving gaps where there is no
          data, the default is to leave no gaps.
        freq : make frequency axis instead of channel axis
 
%A ignore
        Should flags be ignored?  If true, the underlying data values
        are shown, even if non-zero.
        Default: false
