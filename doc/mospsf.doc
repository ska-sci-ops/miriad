        MOSPSF is a MIRIAD task that determines the point spread
        function for a linear mosaic of dirty images (as produced by
        INVERT).
 
        Strictly speaking, the PSF varies with position and frequency.
        However if the pointing grid is fairly complete and the
        individual synthesised beam patterns are similar, the PSF is
        reasonably independent of position.  It is also usually a good
        approximation that it is independent of frequency.
%A beam
        This gives the name of the input beam-cube (as produced by
        INVERT).  No default.
%A out
        The name of the output point-spread function.  It will be the
        same size as the input.
%A radec
        The RA and DEC (either in the form hh:mm:ss,dd:mm:ss or decimal
        hours and degrees) at which to compute the point-spread
        function.  The default is the reference RA,DEC of the beam-cube.
%A freq
        The frequency (in GHz) at which to compute the point-spread
        function.  The default is the reference frequency of the beam-
        cube.  The point-spread function is reasonably independent of
        frequency for most spectral line observations.
