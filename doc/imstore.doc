        IMSTORE is a Miriad task which dumps or tabulates a region of
        an image in a format suitable for other programs.
        Different output modes can be selected.
%A in
      The input file name. No default.
%A region
      The region of interest of the input. Default is the entire input.
      Full region specifations are supported.
      Note: 3D datacubes do not display their 3rd coordinate.
%A clip
      Only image pixels above the clip value are written. The default
      is all data.
%A scale
      Scale factor with which the image data is multiplied
      before output. The default is 1. Note this scaling is done before
      the clip test (as described above).
%A mode
      Output mode. This determines the format of the output. Currently
      accepted are: dump, uvgen and nemo. The default is dump.
 
      mode=dump writes out the values of the selected pixel, only, with
      there being 8 pixels per line.
 
      mode=uvgen produces an output suitable for input to uvgen.
            FLUX,DRA,DDEC,WMAJ,WMIN,WPA,POLN,POLPA
      where the last 5 parameters are set to 0.0. DRA and DDEC are
      given in arcsec w.r.t. the reference pixel if the axis
      type is a recognized astronomical one.
 
      mode=nemo outputs in the format:
            DRA, DDEC, FLUX
%A format
      Override the default mode-dependant output format. Default: none.
      Note: The format specification must be a legal fortran
      format, including the parenthesis; e.g. ``format=(3F20.10)''
%A units
      Units of the output axes. Valid options are "absolute" and
      "relative" (with respect to the reference pixel).
      If an axis is a known astronomical coordinate system, the units
      are displayed in arcsecs. The default is "relative".
%A log
      The output log file. The default is the terminal.
