        VarPlt is a MIRIAD task which plots and lists variables from a
        uv file.
%A vis
        The name of the input data-set. No default.
%A device
        The PGPLOT plotting device to use. The default is no plot.
%A log
        The log to give a listing of the variables. The default is no log.
%A xaxis
        Variable to plot on the X axis. Default is "time".
%A yaxis
        Variable to plot on the Y axis. No default.
%A nxy
        Number of plots in the x and y directions. The default varies.
%A xrange
        The min and max range along the x axis of the plots. The default
        is to autoscale. Note that for "time" should be given in normal Miriad
        time format (either absolute time or time-of-day).
%A yrange
        The min and max range along the y axis of the plots. The default
        is to autoscale. Note that for "time" should be given in normal Miriad
        time format (either absolute time or time-of-day).
%A options
        Extra processing options. Several can be given, separated by
        commas. Minimum match is used.
          "dtime"    If the x-axis is "time", plot the time in fractions
                     of a day. The default is to plot in hh:mm:ss.
          "compress" If the variable is a 2D array of values, average
                     the variables along the second dimension.
          "overlay"  By default, when a variable takes on several values,
                     each is plotted on a separate plot. The overlay
                     option makes a single plot.
          "unwrap"   Unwrap the phases on the yaxis variable. Cannot unwrap
                     an xaxis variable. By default phases are not unwrapped.
