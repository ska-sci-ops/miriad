%B
      UVACFLAG will flag all cross-correlations corresponding to flagged
      auto-correlations.  This can be useful, for example, if you run
      TVFLAG, and flag data based upon the auto-correlations.  You then
      use UVACFLAG and flag all other correlations at the same time when
      the auto-correlations are flagged.
 
%A vis
        Input visibility file. No default.
%A options
        Task enrichment options.  Minimum match is active.
 
        full    Instructs UVACFLAG to tell you about every record
                it flags.  The default is a summary at the end.
