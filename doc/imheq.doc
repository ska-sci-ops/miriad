        IMHEQ -- applies histogram equalization to an image.  This
        technique generates a cumulative histogram of an image.  The
        ordinate for this histogram (number of pixels) is then also
        discretized into the prescribed number of bins.  Each image
        pixel is then replaced by the value of the cumulative
        histogram bin that it contributed to.  This essentially means
        that in terms of a non-cumulative histogram of the image,
        equal numbers of pixels have fallen into each intensity bin
        so that the bins are not of equal intensity width.  This
        technique enables you to see best the intensity range that
        has the most pixels.
 
        Image pixels which are flagged by the image mask will not
        contribute to the histograms.  However, they will be equalized
        in the output image (although their mask will be unchanged).
 
%A in
        The input image. No default.
%A out
        The output image. No default.
%A nbins
        The number of bins for the image histogram.   Default is 128.
%A range
        The intensity minimum and maximum to bin in the histogram.
        Pixels outside this range are set to the nearest limit.
        Default is to use the full image plane range.  Over-rides
        OPTIONS=GLOBAL below.
%A options
        "global" means use the global image minimum and maximum as the
           histogram limits for all image planes.  By default, each
           image plane is equalized with the intensity minimum and
           maximum from that plane.
%A device
        PGPLOT device to show plots of the histograms & discretized
        cumulative histogram. Will plot after each plane, so really
        of use only for single plane images
