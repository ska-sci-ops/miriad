        IMCMP is a MIRIAD task to compare two images. The maps must have
        the same dimensions.
        The two images are compared on a pixel by pixel basis, within a
        user defined region.
%A in1
        The first input image.  No default
%A in2
        The second input image.  No default
%A region
        Region to select data to compare. Only pixels where both input
        maps were unmasked will be compared. Only a rectangular region
        of interest is supported.
%A cut
        Cutoff applied to data. By default not used, all data used.
%A tol
        Tolerance when comparing the absolute difference between the two
        maps on pixel by pixel basis. Default: 0
%A device
        PGPLOT Plotting device. Default: no plot.
%A limx
        Minimum and maximum for plotting the pixel values of image 1.
        Default: autoscaling.
%A limy
        Minimum and maximum for plotting the pixel values of image 2
        Default: autoscaling.
%A log
        File in which to write the data (as two columns).
        Default: no logfile.
