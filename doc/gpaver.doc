%N gpaver
%D Average (smooth) gain solutions.
%P rjs
%: calibration
%B
        GpAver is a Miriad task to average (smooth) antenna gains.
        Currently only boxcar averaging is supported.
%A vis
        The input visibility file, containing the gain file to average.
%A interval
        The time averaging interval, in minutes. The default is 10 minutes.
%A options
          vector  Do vector averaging of the gain amplitudes and
                  phases. This is the default.
          scalar  Do scalar averaging of the gain amplitudes and vector
                  averaging of the gain phases
