%B
        REGRID any combination of the first three axes of an image using
        cubic interpolation, with exclusion of blanked input pixels.
        The output coordinate system may be specified via a template
        image or axis descriptors.
 
        REGRID handles conversion
          - between different map projections,
          - between different map centres (reference points),
          - between B1950 and J2000 equatorial coordinates,
          - between equatorial and galactic coordinates,
          - between radio and optical velocity definitions,
          - between LSR and barycentric velocity frames.
 
        Nearest neighbour interpolation is used for axes smaller than
        five pixels in extent.
 
        REGRID supports the FITS Celestial World Coordinate System
        (WCS) standard as defined in "WCS Paper II",
        Calabretta & Greisen (2002), A&A 395, 1077.
%A in
        The input image name.  In the first instance, coordinate
        descriptors for the output image are copied from the input.
        They may then be overridden by other parameters as described
        below.  No default.
%A out
        The output image name.  No default.
%A axes
        Specify the axes to which 'tin' and 'desc' refer.  For example,
        axes=1,2 resets descriptors for axes 1 and 2.  Likewise,
        axes=2,3 resets descriptors for axes 2 and 3.  In each case, it
        is still possible that another axis will be regridded due to the
        effect of other parameters such as 'rotate', etc.  Note that the
        output always contains the same number of axes as the input.
        The default is all axes.
%A tin
        Template image.  If present, coordinate descriptors for the axes
        to be regridded, as selected by keyword 'axes', are taken from
        the template image rather than the input image.  These axes must
        exist in the template image.
%A desc
        This optionally specifies the reference value (CRVAL), reference
        pixel (CRPIX), coordinate increment (CDELT), and number of
        pixels (respectively) for each and every axis of the output
        image selected by keyword 'axes'.  Thus, if there are any, then
        there must be 4 x naxes values, separated by commas, where naxes
        is the number of axes specified by 'axes'.  These values are not
        changed by any options other than 'offset'.
 
        Note that for celestial axes (RA/DEC, GLON/GLAT, etc.), the
        reference values (CRVAL) and increments (CDELT) are in degrees.
 
        The axis types themselves (CTYPE), including the equatorial
        coordinate system (B1950 or J2000), are taken from the template
        image, if given, else from the input image, subject to
        modification by 'project' and 'options' (see below).
%A rotate
        Set the rotation between the sky and the image to be this angle,
        in degrees.  A positive value of the angle gives an eastward
        rotation of the sky grid relative to the pixel grid.  If the
        celestial axis descriptors came from the template image then the
        default rotation comes from that, else the input image.
%A lonpole
        The native longitude (deg), and...
%A latpole
        ...the native latitude (deg) of the celestial pole, being the
        same as the celestial latitude of the native pole.  Normally
        set by the LONPOLEa and LATPOLEa keywords in FITS, or else by
        PVi_3a and PVi_4a which have precedence, where i is the
        longitude axis number.  Normally only lonpole is needed.
        Together with the two angles specified by CRVAL, these provide
        the third Euler angle for a spherical coordinate transformation
        between celestial spherical coordinates and the projection's
        "native" spherical coordinates as defined by WCS Paper II.  You
        should rarely need to set these.
 
        Defaults are taken from the template image if the projection
        (see below) defaulted from CTYPE in the template image.  Else
        from the input image if the projection defaulted from that.
        Else default values depend on the projection.
%A phi0
        The native longitude (deg), and...
%A theta0
        ...the native latitude (deg) of the fiducial point of the
        projection (i.e. the point whose celestial coordinates are given
        by CRVAL), as defined by WCS Paper II.  Fiddling with these is
        "courageous" in the sense of Sir Humphrey Appleby
        (http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Yes,_Minister).  Set by the PVi_1a
        and PVi_2a keywords in FITS, where i is the longitude axis.
 
        Defaults are taken from the template image if the projection
        (see below) defaulted from CTYPE in the template image.  Else
        from the input image if the projection defaulted from that.
        Else default values depend on the projection.
%A xyzero
        A logical value.  If true, apply an offset so that the origin of
        Cartesian coordinates in the plane of projection corresponds to
        the fiducial point - i.e. (x,y) = (0,0) at (phi0,theta0).  This
        is always the case if (phi0,theta0) assume their default values,
        it only has effect if they are reset (see above).  In FITS this
        logical is set by the PVi_0a keyword, where i is the longitude
        axis.
 
        The default is taken from the template image if the projection
        (see below) defaulted from CTYPE in the template image.  Else
        from the input image if the projection defaulted from that.
        Else false.
%A project
        Three-letter code for the output map projection.  Projection
        codes follow the FITS WCS standard where they are encoded in the
        CTYPE keyword.

        The number of projection parameters is indicated in parentheses.
        These may be set in the pv array (below).  An asterisk indicates
        that the projection has at least one non-defaulting parameter.
        Refer to WCS Paper II for the mathematical definition of the
        projection parameters and their default values.
 
        The letters in parentheses provide a terse summary of the
        projection's special properties:
          - C  conformal
          - C? conformal for particular projection parameters
          - D  divergent
          - D? divergent for particular projection parameters
          - d  degenerate (parts of the sphere overlap in the map plane)
          - E  equi-areal
          - G  global (capable of mapping the whole sphere)
        Some projections may be divergent, degenerate, or global
        depending on the projection parameters.
 
        The default is taken from CTYPE in the template image if given,
        else from the input image.
 
        NOTE that if any value is specified for project, even if the
        same as in the template or input image, then defaults for
        lonpole, latpole, phi0, theta0, and pv will not be taken from
        the template or input image.
%A pv
        Array of up to 30 projection parameters as per the above.  Set
        by the PVi_ma keywords in FITS, where i is the latitude axis
        number.  Note that at least one non-zero parameter must be given
        for ZPN, COP, COE, COD, COO, and BON.
 
        If no parameters are given, defaults are taken from the template
        image if the projection (see above) defaulted from CTYPE in the
        template image.  Else from the input image if the projection
        defaulted from that.  Else default values, where applicable,
        depend on the projection as per WCS Paper II.
%A options
        Extra processing options that alter the axis description defined
        by the template image, axis descriptors, or input image.
        Several can be given, separated by commas, with minimum-match.
          altprj    Interpret a CAR (plate carée) projection in the
                    input ot template image as a simple linear
                    coordinate system with an additional 1/cos(lat0)
                    scaling factor applied when computing the longitude,
                    e.g.
                       RA = (p1 - CRPIX1)*CDELT1/cos(CRVAL2).
                    This interpretation differs significantly from the
                    FITS standard when lat0 (i.e. CRVAL2) is non-zero.
          noscale   Produce a cube where the RA/DEC cell size does not
                    scale with frequency/velocity.
          offset    The coordinate system described by the template or
                    descriptors is modified (shift and expansion or
                    contraction) by an integral number of pixels so that
                    it completely encloses the input.
          equisw    Switch the output coordinate system between J2000
                    and B1950 equatorial.  The output map will be
                    reoriented so that north is upwards, though the
                    coordinate graticule may be oblique nonetheless.
          galeqsw   Switch the output coordinate system between galactic
                    and equatorial.  Galactic switches implicitly to
                    equatorial J2000.  The output map will be reoriented
                    so that the north pole (equatorial or galactic) is
                    upwards, though the coordinate graticule may be
                    oblique nonetheless.
          nearest   Use nearest neighbour interpolation rather than the
                    default cubic interpolation.
        If the equatorial coordinate system is not specified in the
        header (via the 'epoch' item), then J2000 is assumed.
%A tol
        Interpolation tolerance.  Tolerate an error of the specified
        amount in converting pixel locations in the input to the output.
        Must be less that 0.5.  The default is 0.05.
