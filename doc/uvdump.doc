%N uvdump
%D Generate an output text file of information from a visibility dataset.
%P rjs
%: uv analysis
%B
        UVDUMP generates a text file containing information from a visibility
        dataset. This information will usually be used as input to other
        analysis outside Miriad.
 
        For each data record selected, an line is produced in the output
        text file. Each line can consist of several values.
%A vis
        The input UV dataset name. No default.
%A vars
        The name of the values to be written. Possible names are the names
        of visibility variables (with no additional processing), or some
        of the following special names given below. Note these names cannot
        be abbreviated.
          real      Real part of a correlation.
          imag      Imaginary part of a correlation.
          amp       Amplitude of a correlation.
          phase     Phase of a correlation, in degrees.
          flag      Data flag. This is 1 for good data and zero for bad data.
          variance  Theoretical variance of the real/imag parts.
          blno      Baseline number in the form xx-yy (character string).
          ant1      First antenna of the baseline.
          ant2      Second antenna of the baseline.
          polid     Polarization identifier (character string).
          dtime     Offset time, as a fraction of a day, relative to the date of
                    first sample.
          tod       Time-of-day, as a day fraction.
          freq      Frequency of each channel, in GHz.
          uu        U coordinate of the first channel after any frequency averaging
                    is performed. The units are in wavelengths.
          vv        V coordinate. See "uu" above.
          ww        W coordinate. See "uu" above.
        Several names can be given, separated by commas.
%A line
        This selects which channels to include. See the help on `line' for
        more information. The default is to include all data.
%A select
        This selects the data to be processed, using the standard uvselect
        format. Default is all data.
%A stokes
        Normal stokes keyword. The default is to list the unconverted
        polarisations.
%A log
        The list output file name. The default is the terminal.
%A options
        This controls what is listed, and the verbosity. Several can be
        given, separated by commas. Minimum match is used. Possible values
        are:
          flagged   Process flagged data only. By default only unflagged data
                    are processed.
          all       Process all data. By default only unflagged data are processed.
          nofqav    Do not average the channels of each spectral to produce an average
                    value. Note averaging affects the output for values:
                    real,imag,amp,phase,flag,freq,variance,uu,vv,ww. Depending on
                    the "flagged" and "all" options, either just the good, bad or all
                    channels are used in the averaging.
          unwrap    Attempt to unwrap the phase (assumes consecutive data has the
                    same wrap).
          space     By default values are separated by a comma. This option causes the
                    values to be separated by a space instead.
        The following control application of calibration corrections.
          nocal     Do not apply antenna gain calibration.
          nopol     Do not apply polarization leakage correction.
          nopass    Do not apply bandpass response correction.
