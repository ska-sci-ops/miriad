%B
        MOSSDI is a MIRIAD task that performs a Steer CLEAN on a
        mosaiced image or cube.
 
%A map
        The input dirty map, which should have units of Jy/beam
        No default.
%A beam
        The input dirty beam. No default
%A model
        An initial model of the deconvolved image. The default is 0.
%A out
        The name of the output map.  The units of the output will be
        Jy/pixel.
%A gain
        CLEAN loop gain. The default is 0.1.
%A niters
        The maximum number of iterations. The default is 100.
%A cutoff
        Iterating stops if the absolute maximum residual falls below t
        his level.  The default is 0.
        When two values are given, do a deep clean to the second cutoff
        limiting peak finding to the pixels that are already in the
        model.
%A clip
        This sets the relative clip level.  Values are typically 0.75 to
        0.9.  The default is 0.9.
%A region
        The standard region of interest keyword.  See the help on
        "region" for more information. The default is the entire image.
%A options
        Extra processing options:
          positive   Constrain the deconvolved image to be positive
                     valued.
