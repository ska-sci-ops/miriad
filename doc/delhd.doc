    DELHD is a MIRIAD task to delete an item from a MIRIAD dataset.
 
    For image datasets items are not only header variables, such as
    ``crpix1'', ``datamin'' etc., but also the ``mask'' and ``image''
    items.
    For visibility datasets examples of items are ``wflags'', ``gains''
    and ``pdata'', but NOT the uv variables. They cannot be deleted.
    See also copyhd, itemize, mathd and puthd.

          % delhd in=dataset/item
