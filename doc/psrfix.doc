%N psrfix
%D Process and copy a pulsar dataset.
%P rjs
%: uv analysis
%B
        PSRFIX performs de-dispersion, bin averaging/differencing and
        ephemeris correction on an ATCA dataset observed in pulsar
        bin mode.
%A vis
        The name of the input uv data sets. Several can be given. No default.
%A select
        The normal uv selection commands. The default is copy everything.
        See the help on "select" for more information.
%A dm
        This gives up to three numbers, being the pulsar dispersion
        measure, the pulsar period (in seconds) and the frequency to
        de-disperse to (in GHz). The default is a dispersion
        measure of 0, and to de-disperse to the average
        frequency of the first record. If de-dispersing, a pulsar period
        must be given.
        De-dispersion is done including fractional bin shifts.
%A binsl
        Bin selection input. It takes an input string of the form
                       (1,2,4),(4,5,-6),(7,8)
        The output will be three bins, the first will contain the
        sum of the bins 1,2 and 4, the next will contain the sum
        of 4 and 5 minus 6, and the last will contain the sum of
        7 and 8. It is possible to have any combinations of bins.
        However, the number of output bins must be less than or
        equal to the number of input bins.
 
        NOTE: This simply adds and differences multiple bins. It does
        NOT perform any normalization of the result. For example, if
        you sum three bins of equal value, you will get three times the
        flux of each bin in the output
%A out
        The name of the output uv data set. No default.
%A options
        Extra processing options. Several can be given, separated by
        commas. Minimum match is supported.
          nocal   This option suppresses antenna gain calibration. The
                  default behaviour is to apply antenna calibration.
          nopol   This option suppresses polarisation calibration. The
                  default behaviour is to apply polarisation calibration.
          nopass  This option suppresses bandpass calibration. The
                  default behaviour is to apply bandpass calibration.
