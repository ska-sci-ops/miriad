        IMCAT is a MIRIAD task to concatenate several images together
        along an axis (generally the frequency or velocity
        dimension).
%A in
        The input images.  Several file names can be entered, separated
        by commas.  No default.
%A out
        The output image.  No default.
%A axis
        The axis to concatentate together.  The default is the 3rd axis
        (i.e. axis=3).  You cannot concatenate together on the first
        axis.
%A options
        Task enrichment options.  Minimum match is used.  Currently
        there is only a single option:
          relax  This instructs IMCAT to ignore axis descriptor
                 mismatches (e.g. pixel increments etc).  Use this with
                 care.
