        CGREGO is a MIRIAD task to convert polygonal regions specified
        in a text file (such as those generated by CGCURS) into
        an overlay text file (such as that expected by CGDISP)
        so that one can make a line-graphic drawing of a polygonal
        region on an image display.
 
%A region
        The input region text file. No default.
%A olay
        The output overlay text file. Default is input + ".olay"
