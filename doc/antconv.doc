%N antconv
%D convert baseline corrections into antenna corrections
%P pjt
%: calibration, utility
%B
      ANTCONV converts baseline corrections, as they
      come from the Hat Creek Observatory (mostly Rick Forster),
      to antenna based corrections which can be used in uvedit to
      correct your beautiful data. See also UVEDIT.
 
      Example of Correction text file:
           (Delta BL1-2 X)  (Delta BL1-2 Y) (Delta BL1-2 Z)
           (Delta BL1-3 X)  (Delta BL1-3 Y) (Delta BL1-3 Z)
               ....            ....           ....
           (Delta BL1-n X)  (Delta BL1-n Y) (Delta BL1-n Z)
 
%A in
      Name of the input text file containing the baseline corrections for
      baselines involving antenna 1 and each other antenna in the array.
      Note the delta baselines must be 1-n, NOT n-1; so delta baseline
      values for baseline 3-1 must be negated to be delta baselines for
      baseline 1-3.
      The baseline corrections are expected in units of nanoseconds and
      in an f9.6 format (OR separated by commas).
      No default.
%A nants
      Number of antennas.  Default: 3
      NOTE: Currently you should not (have to) change this
      in our 3-element array. Maximum antennas possible is 9.
%A refant
      Reference antenna for new positions. Currently this can ONLY be
      1, which is the default.
      Default: refant=1
