        RESTOR is a MIRIAD task that performs a number of functions
        typically performed after the deconvolution step.  These include
        generating a "CLEAN" map, calculating residuals and convolving
        a model by a Gaussian beam.
 
        RESTOR can also handle multi-frequency synthesis data.  In this
        case the input dirty map should consist of just one plane.  The
        input beam may contain several planes, and the input model may
        have no more planes (but possibly fewer) than the beam.  To get
        the residuals, each plane in the model is convolved with the
        corresponding plane in the beam, and subtracted from the dirty
        map.
%A model
        The model of the deconvolved cube, typically produced by CLEAN
        or MAXEN.  The units of this image should be Jy/pixel.
        No default.
%A beam
        The input dirty beam.  No default.
%A map
        The input dirty cube which should have units of Jy/beam.  May be
        omitted when mode=convolve.  Otherwise, no default.
%A mode
        This can be one of the values:
          "clean"     This is the normal use, and the default, where the
                      output is the map, less the model convolved by the
                      dirty beam, plus the model convolved by the
                      Gaussian.
          "residual"  The output is the map, less the model convolved by
                      the dirty beam.
          "convolve"  The output is the model convolved by the Gaussian.
                      The beam is needed only if the Gaussian fwhm and
                      pa is not specified.  The map is ignored.
          "dirty"     The output is the map convolved with the beam.
%A fwhm
        The size, in arcsec, of the Gaussian beam to use in the
        restoration.  This will normally be two numbers, giving the
        full-width at half-maximum of the major and minor axes of the
        Gaussian.  If only one number is given, the Gaussian will have
        equal major and minor axes.  If no values are given, they are
        either retrieved from the beam header, or computed by fitting a
        Gaussian to the given dirty beam.
 
        Note that the model image is convolved with this Gaussian beam,
        and then added to the residuals.  These residuals are not
        affected by the choice of this Gaussian beam size.  So if you
        want the residuals and convolved image to have approximately the
        same beam size, then the Gaussian beam size chosen should be the
        same size as the dirty beam.  If you want coarser resolution
        than that provided by this, you should use task CONVOL to smooth
        the restored image afterwards.
%A pa
        The position angle, in degrees, of the Gaussian restoring beam,
        measured east from north.  Ignored if no value is given for
        FWHM.  The default is determined from the dirty beam fit.
%A options
        There is only a single option at present:
          "mfs"  If the input model was produced by mfclean and contains
                 a 2nd plane with alpha*I components, using "mfs" will
                 cause restor to write a second plane in the output image
                 containing the alpha*I model convolved with the
                 Gaussian beam. Linmos will use this plane to do
                 wideband primary beam correction if the bw parameter
                 is used.
%A out
        The output restored image.  No default.
