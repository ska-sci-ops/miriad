        UVZFLAG is a MIRIAD task which flags correlations in a
        visibility dataset when either the data are identically zero
        or where the data remain absolutely unchanged between the different
        channels of a spectral window.
%A vis
        The input visibility datasets to be flagged. No default. Several
        datasets can be given. Wildcards are supported.
%A select
        Normal visibility selection, which is applied to the template
        dataset. See the help on "select" for more information.
%A options
        Extra processing options. Several can be given, separated by commas.
        Minimum match is supported. Possible values are:
          zero    By default, uvzflag flags data when the good (unflagged)
                  corrlations in a spectral window are all identical. The `zero'
                  flag causes uvzflag to flag when the data are identically
                  zero.
          noapply Do not apply the flagging, just report the statistics
                  about what would be flagged.
