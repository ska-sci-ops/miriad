%N psrplt
%D Plot pulsar visibility data as a function of bin.
%P rjs
%: uv analysis
%B
        PSRPLT plots pulsar visibility data as a function of bin number.
        The normal display is a pulse profile (bin vs real part of the
        average visibility), but it can also produce a plot against
        frequency.
%A vis
        Name of the input uv data sets.  Several can be given.
        No default.
%A stokes
        Stokes/polarisation parameters to plot.  Default is total
        intensity (Stokes=i).
%A line
        Line-type specification.  default is all channels.
        See the help on "line" for more information.
%A select
        uv selection commands.  Default is to copy everything.
        See the help on "select" for more information.
%A device
        PGPLOT plotting device specification.  No default.
%A offset
        Offset (in arcsec) to shift the uv data.  The sign convention
        is the same as the rest of Miriad.  Default is no shift.
        See the help on "offset" for more information.
%A axis
        This determines the x- and y-axes of the plot.  At the moment,
        the only possibility for the x-axis is:
          bin        Bin number.
        Whereas the y-axis can be
          flux       Plot the flux value.  This is the default.
          frequency  Produce a bin vs frequency greyscale display.
          channel    Produce a bin vs channel greyscale display.
%A range
        The minimum and maximum range used for display. Defaults
        to the range of values in the data.
%A mode
        This determines what "flux" quantity is plotted.  Possible
        values are:
          real      Plot the real part of the data.  Default.
          imaginary Plot the imaginary part of the data.
          amplitude Plot the amplitude of the data.
          phase     Plot the phase of the data.
%A title
        Specify a title for the plot, default is the first file read
%A options
        Extra processing options.  Several can be given, separated by
        commas.  Minimum match is supported.
          nocal     This option suppresses antenna gain calibration.
                    Default is to apply antenna calibration.
          nopol     This option suppresses polarisation calibration.
                    Default is to apply polarisation calibration.
          nopass    This option suppresses bandpass calibration.  The
                    default behaviour is to apply bandpass calibration.
%A log
        File in which to write the data, if y-axis is amplitude.
        The default is no logfile.
