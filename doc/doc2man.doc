  doc2man is a tool that formats a MIRIAD .doc file into an even less
  readable form: the unix man format. However, with X windows utilities
  like xman or hman, a much more superior online help system is created.
  Within miriad a script 'mir.man' or alias 'mirman' should be present
  to aid in starting up a windows based man browser.
  Optionally a section number can be passed to the output man file.

  Usage:
                doc2man [-section] file.doc > file.man
