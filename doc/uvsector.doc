%N uvsector
%D Flag a sector of UV data.
%P rjs
%: calibration
%B
        UVSECTOR flags visibility data with a specific sector.
        The sector can be specified either by position angle, or as
        an hour angle (East-West array assumed) or by way of a stripe
        direction in an image. The latter form
        will be useful when a stripe is seen in an image (implying
        bad visibility data), and you wish to flag out the visibility
        data that could have produced this stripe.
%A vis
        The visibility file to flag. Several files can be given.
        Wildcard expansion is supported. The default is no file.
%A select
        Extra selection criteria. In addition to being in the appropriate
        sector, the data must satisfy the selection criteria before
        it is flagged.
%A angle
        This defines the angle of the axis of the sector, if the sector is
        given by a position angle or hour angle (for an EW array). It
        consists of two values, the first being either the string "uvangle"
        or "hangle" (for position angle and hour angle, respectively). The
        second gives the angle in degrees or hours (for position angle
        and hour angle respectively). Position angle is defined as degrees
        clockwise from the v axis (which is consistent with the uvplt
        definition).
%A in
        If the sectors position angle is given by a stripe direction,
        this gives the name of the image to associate with the stripe.
%A region
        A long, thin, region of the image given above, running in the
        direction of a stripe. This parameter must be given if you
        are defining an hour angle by a stripe direction. Normally
        you will generate this region using CGCURS's region option,
        and generate a region along the ridge of a stripe.
%A width
        The full width of the sector, in degrees. This must be in the
        range (0,180). The default is 5 degrees.
%A options
        Extra processing options. Several can be given, separated by commas.
        Minimum match is used. There is currently only one option.
          noapply    Report on what would be done, but do not apply the
                     flags.
