        ODNH3 is a MIRIAD task that creates optical depth and rotational
        temperature maps from ammonia maps.  Ammonia J,K=(1,1) emission
        has five hyperfine components, one main hyperfine component, two
        inner hyperfine components, and two outer hyperfine components.
 
        Odnh3 takes a main hyperfine component map and either an inner
        or outer hyperfine component map and combines the two maps to
        make a single main hyperfine component optical depth map.
 
        Odnh3 can also combine a J,K=(1,1) main hyperfine component
        map, a J,K=(2,2) main hyperfine component map, and a J,K=(1,1)
        main hyperfine component optical depth map to create a
        rotational temperature map.
 
        Any of the input maps can be masked to allow a signal-to-noise
        cutoff.
 
%A map1
        Input map, main hyperfine component map of the J,K=(1,1) level.
        No default.
%A map2
        Input map, depends on the option given (see "op" below).
        No default.
%A mapt
        Input map required for op=temp.  mapt is the J,K=(1,1) main
        hyperfine component optical depth map.  No default.
%A mask
        A mask expression using FORTRAN syntax.  The optical depth or
        rotational temperature is only calculated at pixels where the
        mask is TRUE.  Thus, this keyword can be used to enforce a
        signal-to-noise cutoff on the input maps.  No default.
%A region
        Standard keyword region. See the help on "region" for more information.
%A op
        The odnh3 option used:
          taui: inner hyperfine component map of the J,K=(1,1) level.
          tauo: outer hyperfine component map of the J,K=(1,1) level.
          temp: main  hyperfine component map of the J,K=(2,2) level.
        No default.
%A out
        Name of the output image.  No default.
