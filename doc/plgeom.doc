        plgeom is a Miriad task used to manipulate and rephase
        a visibility dataset so that an image formed from that
        dataset will result in a facet of that point. It achieves
        this by both applying a shift to the data, and manipulating
        the u-v coordinates. The parameters used to compute noise
        variance of a visibility are also manipulated to account for
        poorer sensitivity when observing the facet at oblique angles.
 
        See Sault, Engel and de Pater (Icarus 2004) for more details
        of its faceting algorithm.
%A vis
        The name of the input uv datasets. Several can be given
        Wildcards are supported. No default.
%A out
        The name of the output uv data-set. There is no default name.
%A select
        The normal uv selection commands. The default is to select everything.
%A latlon
        The latitude and longitude of the facet centre. The latitude
        is planetographic. For Jupiter, the longitude is System III.
%A tol
        When the fractional sensitivity of a modified visibility drops
        below "tol" of the original measurement, then the visibility
        is flagged. The default value is 0.1.
%A options
        This gives extra processing options. Several options can be given,
        each separated by commas. They may be abbreviated to the minimum
        needed to avoid ambiguity. Possible options are:
           nocal       Do not apply the gains table.
           nopass      Do not apply bandpass corrections.
           nopol       Do not apply polarization corrections.
