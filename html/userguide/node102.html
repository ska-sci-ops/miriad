The Clark CLEAN

The Clark CLEAN algorithm <A NAME="tex2html397"

(A&amp;A 26, 89)
is a variant of the H&#246;gbom CLEAN,
and aims at improved speed for large images. The original H&#246;gbom algorithm
spends a lot of time searching residuals which are negligible, and
shifting and scaling the dirty beam. The Clark algorithm avoids these by
searching a list of only the largest residuals, working with only a sub-region
of the beam for much of the time, and by using FFTs to perform convolutions
when it has to resort to using the full beam. This leads to an algorithm which
is more efficient for large images (although a good deal more complicated).
For small images though, the H&#246;gbom CLEAN may
still be faster.

<P>
The Clark CLEAN plays a few tricks which you should know about.  It has
what are termed major and minor cycles.  In the minor cycle, CLEAN
components are searched for, and subtracted from the image, in a fashion
very similar to that of the H&#246;gbom CLEAN.  The difference is that only
the central portion of the dirty beam is used for the subtraction, and a
list of the largest residuals are searched (not the full region being CLEANed).
The rationale is that for dirty beams that have a fairly good sidelobe
pattern, this will be good enough to find the CLEAN components.  At some
designated time, this minor cycle is terminated and a major cycle
computed.  This means that the list of CLEAN components from the current
cycle are `FFTed', and subtracted from the FFT of the residual image
that resulted from the <EM>previous</EM> major cycle.  In this way, errors
that might have accumulated in the subtraction phase of the minor cycle
with only a part of the beam are largely set to rights. It is also at this
stage that the list of the largest residuals is re-determined.

<P>
This use of a small beam patch in the Clark CLEAN is a potential danger
if the beam is poor.   Images made from ATCA snapshot data, even if there are
a few cuts, often have a beam in which the first sidelobe response is
quite strong and outside of the beam patch that the Clark CLEAN typically
uses.
