<I>Miriad</I>'s CLEAN task - surprisingly called <A NAME="tex2html404"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
- implements
the H&#246;gbom, Clark and SDI algorithms.  Given an input dirty image and
beam, it produces an output CLEAN component image which has flux density units
of Jy/pixel.  This CLEAN component image is CLEAN's best guess at what
the source really looks like.  Invariably its extrapolation at high
spatial frequencies is very poor (and probably a reason why AIPS does
not make it easy to view it).  To reduce the undesirable effects of this
extrapolation, and to add in any emission remaining in the residuals, you
will need to use the task <A NAME="tex2html405"
  HREF="../doc/restor.html">restor</A>.  This gives you what is
normally thought of as the `CLEAN' or restored image.

<P>
The various input parameters to <A NAME="tex2html406"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>map, beam</TT>: These keywords give the names of the input image and beam
datasets - as generally produced by <A NAME="tex2html407"
  HREF="../doc/invert.html">invert</A>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>out</TT>: This gives the name of the output CLEAN component image.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>mode</TT>: <I>Miriad</I> <A NAME="tex2html408"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
can perform either H&#246;gbom, Clark or SDI
CLEANs. The <code>mode</code> parameter can be set to indicate the particular
algorithm to use. Possible values are `hogbom', `clark', `steer' or
`any' (the default). With `any', <A NAME="tex2html409"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
determines what it believes is
the best algorithm for your particular image. In this case, <A NAME="tex2html410"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
can
switch between different algorithms, as the nature of the residuals change.
This is particularly useful when CLEANing a large image which contains some
strong point sources and much lower brightness extended emission. In this case,
<A NAME="tex2html411"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
may well switch from a Clark or H&#246;gbom algorithm to the SDI
algorithm when it finds that the residuals are becoming very smooth.

<P>
Generally you can allow <A NAME="tex2html412"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
to choose the algorithm. Task <A NAME="tex2html413"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
will override your choice if you attempt to use the H&#246;gbom
algorithm on an image that is too big.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>region</TT>: As noted above, it is important in <A NAME="tex2html414"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
to limit the CLEAN region to an area one quarter that of the beam, and
to make it fit snugly around the real emission. The
<code>region</code> parameter can be used to describe quite complex CLEANing
regions.  See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node43.html#s:region">6.3</A> on how to specify this.
Alternatively, you can use task <A NAME="tex2html415"
  HREF="../doc/cgcurs.html">cgcurs</A>
to describe
the region interactively from a display of an image on a PGPLOT device.
Task <A NAME="tex2html416"
  HREF="../doc/cgcurs.html">cgcurs</A>
(see Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node138.html#s:pgplot">17.3</A>) can produce a text file,
<code>cgcurs.region</code>, describing the region selected, which you can then
input to <A NAME="tex2html417"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
(see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node18.html#s:atfile">2.5</A>).  For example:

<P>
<PRE>
     region=@cgcurs.region
</PRE>
The default CLEAN region is the largest region (centred on the
dirty image centre) that can be safely deconvolved.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>gain</TT>: A good number for the loop gain is <I>0.1</I> (the default).  If
CLEAN stripes occur, then try lowering the loop gain by a factor of
about 10.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>cutoff, niters, options=negstop</TT>: You can tell <A NAME="tex2html418"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
when to stop in
three ways.  You can tell it to quit once the brightest pixel (in an
absolute sense) in the residual image reaches some cut-off.  This is
typically some multiple of the rms noise level (3-sigma or so).
Specify this level with the parameter <code>cutoff</code>. Alternatively, you
can tell <A NAME="tex2html419"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
to stop when it encounters the first
negative component, by using the <TT>options=negstop</TT> switch. Otherwise,
CLEANing will proceed until <TT>niters</TT> CLEAN iterations have been
performed.  When CLEANing a cube, <code>niters</code> is the number of
iterations per plane.  For small and simple sources, a few hundred
iterations are usually sufficient.  For complicated and large sources,
you can CLEAN forever.

<P>
You can set all three of <TT>cutoff, options=negstop</TT> and <TT>niters</TT>.
Task <A NAME="tex2html420"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
will stop when any one of these stopping criteria
are satisfied.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>phat</TT>: This gives Cornwell's Prussian helmet parameter, which
is the value of
the spike to add to the central lobe of the beam. Using this parameter may
give some success at eliminating CLEAN stripes. When using a Prussian helmet,
typical values are 0.3 or so. Note that the loop gain should also be reduced
when using Prussian helmets.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>model</TT>: If you CLEAN an image, and find that you need to CLEAN some more,
<A NAME="tex2html421"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
can be restarted from where you left off.  Do this by
setting the <code>model</code> parameter to the name of the old output CLEAN component
image, and setting the <code>out</code> parameter to a new name. Actually the
<code>model</code> image need not have been produced by <A NAME="tex2html422"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
- it can be
any image with units of Jy/pixel. Of course, it should be a representation of
your source.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>speed</TT>: The `speedup factor' is a knob for the Clark algorithm which
controls how often major
cycles are performed.   The more major cycles, the closer a Clark CLEAN
is to a H&#246;gbom CLEAN. For point sources, this can be about 1.  For
extended sources, or if you are having trouble with CLEAN stripes, set
<code>speed</code> to some small negative number - typically -1 is good.
The default is 0.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>minpatch</TT>: For Clark CLEANs, the parameter <code>minpatch</code> is the
minimum full width (<EM>not</EM> half-width, as it is in AIPS) of the beam patch
used in the minor cycle. The default is 51. However, for ATCA work, where
the beam can often have large distant sidelobes, and so this value may be too
small.
Setting <code>minpatch</code> to larger values will slow the
algorithm, but may avoid CLEAN striping problems. The maximum value that
<A NAME="tex2html423"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
will accept is 257 - larger values will be trimmed back to
257.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>clip</TT>: For SDI CLEANs, this parameter gives the `clip level'.
During an SDI iteration, all pixels greater than <code>clip</code> times the
peak flux density are considered to represent true structure, and so are taken
as components for that iteration.  Typically the clip level is 0.9.  The
default that <A NAME="tex2html424"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
computes is image dependent, and will be a
function of how many pixels there are across the beam.  The default
value is usually adequate.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>options</TT>, as usual, gives several processing options. Possible
values are
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>negstop</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Stop CLEANing when the first negative component is
encountered.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>positive</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Apply a positivity constraint. This constrains the
component image to be non-negative. A side-effect of this is that CLEAN will
stop iterating if it cannot continue to ensure this. This does not have
any effect with SDI iterations. This option does not seem to produce
as much improvement as one might hope.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>asym</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Normally <A NAME="tex2html425"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
assumes that the beam has a 180
degree rotational symmetry, which is the norm in radio interferometry.
Making such an assumption allows some optimisations. You should instruct
<A NAME="tex2html426"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
if this is not the case, by using the <TT>asym</TT> switch.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>pad</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>Double the beam size by padding it with zeros. This will
give better stability with Clark and Steer modes if you are daring enough
to CLEAN an area which is more than a quarter of the beam area.
</DD>

<P>
The total CLEANed flux density (<I>i.e.</I> the cumulative sum of the CLEAN
components) should eventually settle down to a roughly constant number.
This indicates that you
are just picking up noise, and that there are no sidelobes left to
remove.  If the total CLEANed flux density starts to decrease again, this
usually indicates that you have been a bit heavy handed, and CLEANed too
much.  You might also look at the result and see if you can see any
sidelobes left over.

<P>
Having completed <A NAME="tex2html427"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>, you will almost certainly want to ``restore''
your image - see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node112.html#s:restor">14.6</A>.
