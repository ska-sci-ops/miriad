The Linear Method - IMMERGE</A>
</H2>
The linear method, sometimes known as feathering, can be thought of in terms 
of operations in the
Fourier (spatial frequency) domain of the images. If the single-dish 
image  is a good representation of the object at low spatial frequencies,
and if the mosaic
image is a good representation at mid to high spatial frequencies, then the
two sorts of data can be merged in the Fourier plane to form an image
accurate up to the resolution of the mosaic image. This is exactly what
<A NAME="tex2html958"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
does.

<P>
The way that <A NAME="tex2html959"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
normally combines the data is to give unit 
weight to the single-dish data
at all spatial frequencies, and to taper the low spatial frequencies of
the mosaic data. This tapering is such that the sum of single dish and tapered
mosaic data produces a gaussian beam equal to the
mosaic gaussian beam. Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:immerge">21.1</A> shows this process
for a point source. The Parkes data plus the tapered ATCA data neatly
add to give an overall response of a gaussian form.

<P>
The inputs to <A NAME="tex2html960"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
are moderately straightforward:
the <TT>in</TT> parameter
gives the name of the input mosaic and single-dish image (in that
order), whereas the <TT>out</TT> parameter gives the
name of the output dataset.
Because <A NAME="tex2html961"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
assumes that the beams of both the single-dish and
mosaic images are gaussian forms,
you will want to use images which approximate this.
Whereas single-dish images usually approximate this reasonably, a dirty
mosaic does not. Instead, 
<EM>you will want to use a deconvolved/restored mosaic</EM>
in the <A NAME="tex2html962"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
process.

<P>
Task <A NAME="tex2html963"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
allows you to set a parameter giving the flux
calibration factor,
<TT>factor</TT>: <A NAME="tex2html964"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
multiplies the single-dish image by
this factor before further processing. If you believe your calibration,
you should set this parameter to 1 (or whatever number you believe the
calibration factor to be). Note that if the parameter is unset,
<A NAME="tex2html965"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
attempts to deduce this factor (i.e. the default is not
simply to use a value of 1). It does this
by comparing data in the overlap annulus in the spatial frequency coverage
of the mosaic and single-dish images. In doing this <A NAME="tex2html966"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
first
convolves the mosaic image to the same resolution as the single dish data
(including scaling fiddles to
account for the inputs being in Jy/beam in differing resolutions),
and it then performs a robust (L1) fit between the two sets of pixel
data. If you use <A NAME="tex2html967"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
to determine the flux calibration factor,
you will want to consider setting the following parameters:

<UL>
<LI><TT>uvrange</TT> giving the range in the Fourier domain
where there is overlap. This parameter can take two or three values,
the first two being the numbers giving the inner and outer radius of
the overlap region, and the third parameter giving the units of the first two
values. The most useful units are <TT>meters</TT> and <TT>klambda</TT>
(kilowavelengths - which is the default). For example, typically the overlap
between a Parkes and ATCA observation (assuming the shortest ATCA
spacing is included in the observation) would be
<PRE>
   uvrange=25,40,meters
</PRE>
The default is to use all spatial frequencies.
</LI>
<LI><TT>region</TT> parameter allows you to select those planes
used in determining the flux calibration factor. Unlike the normal behaviour
of <TT>region</TT> parameter, <EM>only plane selection</EM> is allowed, with the
<TT>image</TT> sub-command being the only really useful command.
Generally you would choose
planes with appreciable structure which is well represented
in both single-dish and mosaic data. The default is to include all planes.
</LI>
<LI><TT>device</TT> sets the PGPLOT plotting device where plots are make of 
a comparison between the data in the overlap region. Two plots are produced.
For the first plot, the axes gives the 
value of a pixel (both real or imaginary values are included) in the mosaic
(<I>x</I> axis) and single-dish data (<I>y</I> axis). These pixel values are after
tapering, scale factor fiddles, and after applying the calibration scale factor that
has just be deduced. The data should follow a ``<I>y=x</I>'' form (which is
also plotted in red). The second plot gives the residual difference
between the mosaic and single-dish data (i.e. the difference from <I>y=x</I>) as 
a function of spatial frequency. A trend in these residuals might suggest 
that the single-dish beam parameters are grossly wrong.
Although the default is not to create a plot, there seems little reason
why you would not want to inspect it.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The gaussian parameters of the mosaic and single-dish beams are important
parameters in the processing that <A NAME="tex2html968"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
performs. Task <A NAME="tex2html969"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
tries to determine these by first looking for the relevant gaussian beam
parameters within the image datasets. If it cannot find these, it will
attempt to estimate the beams, based on its knowledge of the telescope and
the observing
frequency. These estimates, however, are far from perfect - <EM>it is
far better to ensure that the beam parameters are within the dataset
before using <A NAME="tex2html957"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A></EM>. If you are unsure whether the beam
parameters have been set for a dataset, <A NAME="tex2html970"
  HREF="../doc/prthd.html">prthd</A>
includes these
(if found) in amongst the information it prints out.
For the  mosaic, normally <A NAME="tex2html971"
  HREF="../doc/restor.html">restor</A>
will have
saved the beam parameters in the dataset. However it is likely that you
will need to add the single-dish beam parameters to the single-dish dataset.
The items you want to set are <TT>bmaj</TT>, <TT>bmin</TT> and possible <TT>bpa</TT>
(beam major, minor axis size and position angle respectively), which are 
set using <A NAME="tex2html972"
  HREF="../doc/puthd.html">puthd</A>.

<P>
When emission continues to the edge of the image (or near the edge),
algorithms such as that used by <A NAME="tex2html973"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
can suffer edge artifacts.
If these are problematic, 
<A NAME="tex2html974"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
has a some parameters which you might like to try to reduce
the problem.
Task <A NAME="tex2html975"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
pads images with
a guard band before doing a Fourier transform. Edge effects may be lessened
by increasing this from the default value by setting the <TT>guard</TT> parameter.
Task <A NAME="tex2html976"
  HREF="../doc/immerge.html">immerge</A>
also tries to avoid edge discontinuities by padding the
guard band with a mirror image of some of the data. If the image is mostly
zero, then zero padding (rather than than a reflection) might be better.
In this case use <TT>options=zero</TT>.
