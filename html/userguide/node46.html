<TT>ATLOD:</TT> Reading RPFITS Files
</H1>

<P>
ATCA data will be initially in RPFITS format.  This needs to be converted to
<I>Miriad</I>'s format, by task <A NAME="tex2html63"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>, before any further processing
can be done.
We will discuss the various input parameters to <I>Miriad</I> <A NAME="tex2html64"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>.

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The <TT>in</TT> parameter gives the name of the input UNIX file, or files,
to load. Many files can be given, and wildcards are supported.

<P>
RPFITS files are commonly archived on CDROMs: a CDROM appears much like
a disk to the operating system, and <A NAME="tex2html65"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>
can load RPFITS files
directly off these. To use a CDROM drive,
first check that the drive is not in use (an orange light flashing). On Solaris
to load a CDROM, press the Open/Close on the front of the drive, place
the CDROM in
and again press the Open/Close button. After about 10 seconds, the operating
system will mount the CDROM, and it can be accessed.
CDROMs written at the ATCA will have the RPFITS data in the
directory
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>/cdrom/cdrom<I>x</I>/DATA</TT>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <I>x</I> is 0 for the first drive of a machine, 1 for the second, etc
(you can do a directory listing to see what you have - its like a normal
file system!).
You can set the <TT>in</TT> parameter to the RPFITS files in this directory.
For example, to select all files belonging to project C561 (assuming you are
using the first CDROM drive), use
<PRE>
  in=/cdrom/cdrom0/DATA/*.C561
</PRE>
When you are done with a CDROM drive you eject it with the Solaris UNIX command
<PRE>
   eject cdrom
</PRE>
(the Open/Close button will not work).

<P>
RPFITS files are (or at least were once) commonly written to exabyte
tapes. Unlike other <I>Miriad</I> tasks, <A NAME="tex2html66"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>
can read exabytes
directly. In this case you should use the physical device name as the
input name. This is usually
displayed on the exabyte drive. On the Epping Solaris systems, the device
name is usually <code>/dev/rmt/0lbn</code> or similar
(this is the so-called non-rewinding, raw, BSD compatibility interface).
On older Solaris systems, it may be <code>/dev/nrst4</code> or something similar
(non-rewinding, raw interface).

<P>
An alternative to directly reading from exabyte is to load the data to
disk with the Unix commands <A NAME="tex2html67"
  HREF="/cgi-bin/miriad/mirman.pl?topic=ansiread">ansiread</A>
or <A NAME="tex2html68"
  HREF="/cgi-bin/miriad/mirman.pl?topic=ansitape">ansitape</A>, which are
available on a number of the ATNF systems.  See the
UNIX <A NAME="tex2html69"
  HREF="/cgi-bin/miriad/mirman.pl?topic=man">man</A>
pages for more information.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <TT>out</TT> parameter gives the name of the output <I>Miriad</I> visibility
dataset. There is no default.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The <TT>options</TT> parameter gives miscellaneous processing options.
thatfairly It is important to
Several values can be given, separated by commas.
As loading RPFITS data can be time-consuming (particularly when loading
from exabyte), and as the right options for <A NAME="tex2html70"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>
can save
considerable disk space, it is sensible to spend a few moments thinking
about the correct options to use.
A few sets of permutations of the options will be appropriate with most
observations. These include:

<UL>
<LI>For continuum: <code>options=birdie,xycorr</code> or
<code>options=birdie,reweight,xycorr</code>. See below for a discussion on
whether to use <code>reweight</code> or not.
</LI>
<LI>For non-polarimetric line: <code>options=birdie</code> or
<code>options=birdie,compress</code> or <code>options=birdie,hanning</code>
or <code>options=birdie,compress,hanning</code>. See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node126.html#s:specrpfits">16.3</A>
for more on using <A NAME="tex2html71"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>
with spectral line data and
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node209.html#s:hires">24.2</A> for high time resolution bin-mode data.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Possibilities options are:

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>birdie</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The ATCA suffers from self-interference at frequencies
which are a multiple of 128 MHz. The birdie option flags out the channels
affected by this self-interference. This option is strongly recommended.

<P>
Additionally, in the 33 channel/128 MHz mode, the birdie option
also discards some edge channels and every other channel. This operation
does not incur a sensitivity penalty, as correlator channels are not
independent in this mode. The net result is that
the output consists of either 13 or 14 good channels.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>xycorr</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In polarimetric correlator configurations, the
ATCA makes an on-line measurement of the phase difference between the
<I>X</I> and <I>Y</I> channels. Although it is generally only a few
degrees (assuming the observation was correctly set-up), this
phase difference should be corrected when doing polarimetric work.
Since a hardware upgrade in November 1992, the recommendation has
been that the on-line measurements should
be applied, without averaging, using the <code>xycorr</code> option in <A NAME="tex2html72"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>.
For data prior to November 1992 - seek expert advise.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>reweight</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>In the 33 channel/128 MHz mode, a Gibbs
phenomena (see Albert Bos in the <I>Indirect Imaging</I> proceedings)
affects the
ATCA. This introduces a non-closing error into the data.
The effect is moderately subtle, and is not significant for
dynamic ranges of less than about 500. The `reweight' option reweights
the visibility spectrum in the lag domain to eliminate this problem.

<P>
This option is recommended for high dynamic range work (more than
about 500). However, the option also reduces the effectiveness of the birdie
option to reject self-interference. This can be a significant effect for
20cm continuum observations, where the usual observing band straddles
the 1408 MHz birdie. Particularly at 20cm, the reweight option is <EM>not
recommended</EM> where dynamic ranges of less than 500 are expected.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>compress</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Normally the correlation data are stored as
32-bit floating point numbers.
Alternatively, the <TT>compress</TT> switch can be used to instruct
<A NAME="tex2html73"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>
to store the correlations as 16-bit integers,
with a scale factor associated with each spectrum. This approximately
halves the disk space occupied by a dataset, and so may be very
advantageous for large spectral-line observations.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>hanning</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Hanning<A NAME="1924"></A> smooth the data, and
discard every second
channel. This can be useful for spectral line experiments. Task <A NAME="tex2html74"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>
will refuse to Hanning smooth data with 33 channels or less.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>bary</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Use the barycentre (often called heliocentre
and usually used for extra-galactic work) as the rest frame when calculating
velocity information. The default is to compute velocity information
relative to the LSR frame (which is usually used for Galactic work).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>hires</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This option may be appropriate for observations
using the ATCA's high time resolution bin mode. See Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node207.html#c:pulsar">24</A>
for more information.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>opcorr</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This option corrects the visibility data for
atmospheric opacity. It is since October 2003 that there is sufficient
information in the visibility dataset to allow this.
This options <EM>should not</EM> be used for 3mm data. Generally it is relevant
for 12mm observations only. See Sections&nbsp;<A HREF="node187.html#s:atlod12mm">22.1</A> and <A HREF="node198.html#s:atfix">23.2.2</A>
for more information.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>samcorr</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Correct the measured visibilities for bad
sampler statistics. Normally the samplers adjust their various threshold
levels to ensure optimal operation. However various transients can cause
the sampler levels to be wrong. All is not lost - you can correct the
data for the imperfect sampler levels after the fact. Use the <TT>samcorr</TT>
(sampler-correct) option for this, and is the recommended
approach for data observed before December 1993. Since December 1993,
sampler correction
has been done automatically on-line. For this data, the <code>samcorr</code> option
is (quietly) ignored.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>relax</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This option is generally not recommended.
Normally <A NAME="tex2html75"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>
flags data if it has not
previously read the appropriate calibration record or if the information
in the calibration record suggest the data are bad.  Although calibration
records generally precede the data, there are some instances when this
is not the case, and the data are still good.  In this case, the
<TT>relax</TT> option causes <A NAME="tex2html76"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>
to be more lenient, and not flag
the data.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>unflag</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Normally <A NAME="tex2html77"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>
will discard a visibility record
(i.e. not write it to disk) if all the data in it are flagged bad.
Flagging usually indicates that there was
significant reason to suspect the data -  for example the telescope was not on
source or was off-line, etc. The <TT>unflag</TT> option causes all data to
be saved to disk, although flagged
data is still marked as such. This option is generally not recommended,
although the disk-space penalty for using it is often modest.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>noauto</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>and <TT>nocross</TT> cause <A NAME="tex2html78"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>
to discard
any autocorrelation or cross-correlation data respectively. Its
fairly unlikely that you will want to discard the cross-correlation data!
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>noif</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>When there are multiple frequency bands being
observed simultaneously, <I>Miriad</I> normally maps the frequency bands
to its spectral windows (IF axis in AIPS terminology), and writes
them out in a single record. Alternatively,
using the <TT>noif</TT> switch causes <A NAME="tex2html79"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>
to write the
simultaneous frequencies as sequential records, making it appear
somewhat like a frequency-switch. You will need to use the <code>noif</code>
option if you have two spectral windows which sample different
polarization parameters.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>nopflag</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>If at least one polarization of a set of 2 or 4 polarimetric
spectra are bad, <A NAME="tex2html80"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>
normally flags all of the
polarizations. With this option only
the nominally bad spectrum is flagged.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>nscans</TT> gives two numbers which are the number of scans to skip
over (before processing), and the number of scans to save. The default is
to save all scans.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>nfiles</TT>, like <TT>nscans</TT>, gives two numbers, which are the
number of files to skip and process. This parameter is only really
useful when reading from exabyte. The default is to process the first file
only.
Note, however, that the mechanism used to skip files is rather
inefficient.  If you wish to skip a large number of files, you should
do this with the Unix command <A NAME="tex2html81"
  HREF="/cgi-bin/miriad/mirman.pl?topic=mt">mt</A>.  A
complication is that every RPFITS file appears as three files to <A NAME="tex2html82"
  HREF="/cgi-bin/miriad/mirman.pl?topic=mt">mt</A> - so you will want to skip three times as many tape files as RPFITS
files.  For example, to skip 10 RPFITS files, you would use the Unix
command

<I>Miriad</I>'s <A NAME="tex2html86"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>
saves a number of
on-line measurements as visibility variables.  These measurements may by
helpful in analysing and flagging the data.  They can be plotted and
listed with task <A NAME="tex2html87"
  HREF="../doc/varplt.html">varplt</A>
(see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node71.html#s:exavis">10.6</A>).  These
on-line parameter, and its <I>Miriad</I> variable name, are described below.

<P>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>xyphase</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the on-line measurement of the <I>XY</I> phase.
It is important to examine this measurement if you are doing polarimetry.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>xyamp</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is the amplitude of the correlation between the
<I>X</I> and <I>Y</I> polarization channel of a given antenna.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>xsampler, ysampler</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>These variables give the sampler statistics for
the 
<BR>
MMX and <I>Y</I> polarization channels.  There are three numbers per
antenna per IF, which reflect the sampler levels.  They should have values of
<I>17.3</I>, <I>50</I> and <I>17.3</I>.  Thus for six antennas, the <TT>xsampler</TT> variable
will consist of 18 numbers per IF.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>xtsys, ytsys</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>These give the system temperature, in Kelvin, for the
<I>X</I> and <I>Y</I> polarization channels. Unfortunately <I>Miriad</I> tasks were
originally developed around a single polarization model of a telescope, and so
most tasks that concern themselves with system temperature do not handle
dual polarization systems. The partial workaround used in <I>Miriad</I> has been
to store the geometric mean of the <I>X</I> and <I>Y</I> system temperatures in the
variable <TT>systemp</TT>.
It is this variable that <I>Miriad</I> tasks use when they need to use the
system temperature value.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>axisrms, axismax</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>These give the antenna rms and maximum tracking
errors in a particular cycle. The units are arcseconds.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>airtemp,pressmb,relhumid,wind,winddir</TT>:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>These give various
meterological measurements at the observatory as a function of time.
