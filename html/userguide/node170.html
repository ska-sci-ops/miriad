Summary of Imaging Strategies</A>
</H1>
There are two quite distinct methods for reducing a mosaic experiment - the
so-called ``joint'' and ``individual'' approaches. Although hybrid approaches
are also conceivable, they will not be discussed.

<P>
The joint approach, which is the simplest, takes advantage of <I>Miriad</I>'s
mosaicing software.
In this case, all pointings are handled simultaneously by the imaging
and deconvolution software.
With the individual approach, a mosaic experiment is
treated like a large
number of conventional observations, where each pointing is
imaged and deconvolved separately. In this case you, the user, are 
responsible for keeping track of all the pointings. Only as a final
step are all the pointings pieced together.

<P>
The advantage of the joint approach is speed and simplicity.  Also
because the deconvolution of all the pointings is done together, it can
produce fundamentally better deconvolutions.  This is particularly so
for low signal-to-noise ratio mosaics and for extended emission
(emission comparable in extent to the primary beam - see Cornwell's
papers for the argument).  It is the approach normally used.  However
there are disadvantages - the joint approach depends more critically on
the model of the primary beam.  Errors in the model of the primary beam
will tend to be amplified by this approach, particularly when the
<I>u-v</I> coverage is poor.  Generally the joint approach will be limited
to dynamic ranges of several hundred or so. 

<P>
A more practical difference between the two approaches is that the joint
approach generally uses significantly less disk space (this can be an
order of magnitude or more for spectral line experiments). However,
because the joint
approach does all pointings simultaneously, it does use significantly more
computer memory in its reduction steps. With current computers, the joint
approach is not possible for full resolution ATCA images (6 km array) if
you have more that a few pointings.

<P>
