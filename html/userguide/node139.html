Common Keywords
</H2> 

<P>
This suite has many common keywords and much common functionality.  We
describe briefly now some of the common keywords, although not all the
tasks in the suite use them in all possible ways.  Refer to the
individual help files to see what each task offers.  Specific uses by
<A NAME="tex2html617"
  HREF="../doc/cgspec.html">cgspec</A>
will be described in Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node151.html#c:spectra">19</A>.  Note that
minimum match is usually accepted for the value of keywords.  Each
keyword usually defaults to the same value in all tasks, but you
should again refer to the help files for details. 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>The keyword <TT>in</TT> takes a list of input images as its arguments.
These images are displayed or used in the display in some way indicated
by the keyword <TT>type</TT>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The keyword <TT>type</TT> indicates how the images given in the <TT>in</TT> keyword will be displayed.  These two keywords are in one to one
correspondence with each other.  Possible values are <TT>pixel</TT>
(display image as a pixel map representation, formerly called a grey
scale, but now full colour is available), <TT>contour</TT> (display image
as a contour map), <TT>box</TT> (display image as little boxes, where the
size of the box is proportional to the value of the pixel, and it is
hollow for positive and solid for negative values), <TT>amplitude</TT> and
<TT>angle</TT> (display these two images as line vectors).  In addition,
<TT>type</TT> can take on the value <TT>mask</TT>.  In this case, the relevant
image given in the keyword <TT>in</TT> is not displayed, but its pixel
blanking mask is applied to all the other images which are being
displayed.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The standard <I>Miriad</I> keyword <TT>region</TT> is used to select the
region of the images for display.  It interacts with the keyword <TT>chan</TT> (see below) which allows you to group planes (or channels)
together onto separate subplots.  The region selected applies to all the
input images and they must all have the same size on the first 2 axes. 
However, you can input a mix of 3-D and 2-D images.  If you input more
than one 3-D image, they must all have the same size on the third axis. 
Any 3-D region selection indicated with the <TT>region</TT> keyword is
applied only to the 3-D images that you input.  An example of this usage
would be overlaying a continuum image on each channel of a spectral line
cube. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The keyword <TT>xybin</TT> allows you to spatially bin up (average)
pixels, or to pick out pixels at regular increments.  This can be very
handy for displaying large images, especially if you are making a hard
copy on a postscript printer where the printer resolution does not merit
retaining the individual pixels.  Using this keyword can make the
postscript file much smaller and print much faster.    

<P>

<P>
<BR>
You can bin up the two spatial axes of an image independently, and
you can enter up to 4 values, 2 for each axis specifying the increment
and binning size.  As an example, <TT>xybin=4,4,3,1</TT> would bin up the
image by 4 pixels in the <I>x</I> direction and pick out every third pixel
in the <I>y</I> direction.  If the binning size is not unity, it must
equal the increment. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The keyword <TT>chan</TT> is used to allow you to group the planes
(or channels) that you selected with the keyword <TT>region</TT> onto
separate subplots of the plotting page.  The first value you give is the
channel increment to step through the image in.  The second value is the
number of channels to average, for each sub-plot.  For example, <TT>chan=5,3</TT> would average groups of 3 planes together, starting 5 channels
apart such as 1-3, 6-8, 11-13 and so on. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The channels available are those designated by the <TT>region</TT>
keyword.  A new group of channels (sub-plot) is started if there is a
discontinuity in the <TT>region</TT> selected channels (such as <TT>region=image(10,20),image(22,30)</TT>.  The combination of the <TT>region</TT>
and <TT>chan</TT> determines how many sub-plots there will be. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The keywords <TT>slev</TT> and <TT>levs</TT> (or <TT>levs1, levs2, levs3</TT>
in <A NAME="tex2html618"
  HREF="../doc/cgdisp.html">cgdisp</A>
- it can draw up to 3 contour maps at once) indicate at
what values the contours should be drawn.  The first value of <TT>slev</TT>
can be <TT>p</TT> or <TT>a</TT>, indicating percentage or absolute levels. 
The second value of <TT>slev</TT> is a scale factor to multiply the contour
levels given in <TT>levs</TT> by.  For example, <TT>slev=p,1</TT> and <TT>levs=-1,1,2,4,8,16</TT> would draw contours at -1%, 1%, 2%, 4%,
8% and 16% of the peak value in the image.  On the other hand, <TT>slev=a,0.001</TT>, <TT>levs=3,5,10</TT> would draw contours at values of
0.003, 0.005, 0.01. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The keyword <TT>range</TT> is used to control the way in which pixel
intensities are mapped onto the colour lookup table of the device for
pixel map representations (<TT>type=pixel</TT>).  Its use varies somewhat
from task to task, but the basic functionality is the same; see the
individual help files for details.   See also <TT>options=fiddle</TT>
which provides an interactive way to alter the lookup tables.

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The first two values indicate the range of pixel values
(intensities) to map onto the lookup table.  Pixels with values outside
this range will be represented with the colour of the nearest extremum. 
Thus, if the image was being displayed with a simple linear black and
white transfer function on an interactive device, <TT>range=<I>-0.2</I>,
<I>2.0</I></TT> would cause all pixels with values below <I>-0.2</I> to come out
black, all pixels with values greater than <I>2.0</I> to come out white, and
all pixels in between that range to have shades of grey from black to
white. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The third argument of <TT>range</TT> allows you to specify a
transfer function so that the pixel values can be mapped onto the lookup
table in some way other than linearly.  Allowed values are <TT>lin,sqr,log,heq</TT> for linear, square root, logarithmic and histogram
equalisation transfer functions respectively.  Histogram equalisation can be very
handy for images which have a large dynamic range.  What this does is
use the device colour levels for pixel values which occur the most
often. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The fourth argument of <TT>range</TT> is an integer between 1 and
9 specifying the type of lookup table.  The available tables are 1
(b&amp;w), 2 (spectrum colours), 3 (linear pseudo colour), 4 (floating zero
colour contours), 5 (fixed zero colour contours), 6 (rgb), 7
(background), 8 (heat) and 9 (absolute b&amp;w) .  If you enter a negative
integer, then the reversed lookup table is displayed.   

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Fixed zero colour contours fix a colour boundary (blue-green)
at 0 intensity, with 4 colour pairs ([light blue, light green], [dark
blue, dark green], [purple,yellow], [black,orange]) distributed positive and
negative of 0.  There are then two more colours (red and white) for the
remaining positive intensity values.  Once you have arranged the colour
pairs so that they define the noise level, the red and white colours
quickly show you the true signal.  You need to use <TT>options=fiddle</TT>
to get the scaling to the noise level right. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Note that in <A NAME="tex2html619"
  HREF="../doc/cgdisp.html">cgdisp</A>, you can enter a group of 4 values
for each subplot that is drawn.  This is useful for hardcopy output, as
you can have an individual scaling and lookup table for each
subplot.  For example, you may have made a ``cube'' with unlike
quantities in different planes (total intensity, polarised intensity,
fractional polarisation, rotation measure etc) and it would be
impossible to display them all with just one set of 4 values for the
<TT>range</TT> keyword. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
The following figure shows the possible colour table types for
a simple image.  The colour bars or wedges show the differences most
clearly. 

<P>

<P><IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM ALT="" SRC="colours.gif"><P>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The keyword <TT>device</TT> indicates the PGPLOT device upon
which the plot will be drawn.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The keyword <TT>nxy</TT> takes two values, which are the number
of subplots in the <I>x</I> and <I>y</I> directions on the page (dictated
by the <TT>chan</TT> keyword).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The keyword <TT>labtyp</TT> specifies what units the axes will
be labelled in.    It can take two values and they can be different.

<P>
Possible values are:

<P>

<UL>
<LI><TT>hms</TT> for a label in H M S.S (e.g. for RA)

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>dms</TT> for a label in D M S.S (e.g. for DEC)

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>arcsec</TT> for a label in arcsecond offsets

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>arcmin</TT> for a label in arcminute offsets

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>absdeg</TT> for a label in degrees

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>reldeg</TT> for a label in degree offsets

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>abspix</TT> for a label in pixels

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>relpix</TT> for a label in pixel offsets

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>abskms</TT> for a label in km/s

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>relkms</TT> for a label in km/s offsets

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>absghz</TT> for a label in GHz

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>relghz</TT> for a label in GHz offsets

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>absnat</TT> for a label in natural units as given
by the axis label.  

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>relnat</TT> for a label in offset natural coordinates

<P>
</LI>
<LI><TT>none</TT> for no label and no numbers or ticks on the axis

<P>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<BR>
All the offsets are with respect to the reference pixel.  Note
that you are expected to match your values with the order of the axes. 
For example, if you asked for <TT>labtyp=abskms,dms</TT>, it is expected
that the first two axes of the image are velocity and declination.  You
will get rude messages if this is not the case. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The keyword <TT>csize</TT> gives you control over the size of
characters on the plot such as axis labels, or annotation text.
These are given as factors of the default PGPLOT character
size <TT>csize=1.0</TT>, which gives a character about 1/40 of the
maximum dimension of the view surface.  See the help files for
details on what you can control in which task.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The keyword <TT>options</TT> offers a variety of enrichment options
for each task.  There are a few that are common to most
of the tasks in this suite. 

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Option <TT>wedge</TT> causes a labelled colour bar or wedge to be
drawn, showing the mapping between pixel intensity and colour. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Option <TT>fiddle</TT> invokes the interactive lookup table fiddler. 
This is mouse (or keyboard) driven, and
instructions are given the in the window from which you invoked the
task.  Basically, it is tree structured, with one branch to select
different colour lookup tables, and one branch to modify the transfer
function.  You can swap between these branches. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
This option allows you to cycle through all of the same colour
tables offered by keyword <TT>range</TT> (see above), and reverse them if
desired.  You can cycle through all of the same pre-defined transfer
functions that are available with keyword <TT>range</TT> (see above). 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
In addition, there is an interactive linear transfer function
fiddle mode, where you can change the slope and offset of the linear
transfer function.  When you invoke the different transfer function
modes, you get a little plot in the bottom right corner showing you what
the transfer function is doing. 

<P>

<P>
<BR>
Note that if you are plotting on a hard-copy device such as a
postscript file, this option is then activated with keyboard inputs. 
You have the usual ability to cycle through lookup tables and transfer
functions, but you do not get the interactive linear transfer function
fiddler for obvious reasons.  This gives you the same functionality as
you could have obtained with the keyword <TT>range</TT>. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Option <TT>grid</TT> extends the coordinate ticks into a 
full grid.  Minor ticks are excluded with this option. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The option <TT>unequal</TT> instructs the software to fill the
plotting page maximally.  By default, is tries to make the scales of the
<I>x</I> and <I>y</I> axes the same.  It is important that you use this
option when you are displaying unlike quantities such as a velocity-DEC
diagram, as the efforts to make equal scales will go wrong here.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Option <TT>relax</TT> instructs these tasks not to be concerned
if the axis descriptors for the input images are different.  The axis
sizes still have to be the same though.  Use this option with great
care, and it's only useful if you are labelling the axes with
<TT>abspix</TT> or <TT>relpix</TT> types.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When you are displaying multiple subplots, with each
subplot being a different channel or plane from a 3-D image,
the options <TT>3value</TT> and <TT>3pixel</TT> instruct the software
to write the coordinate value and pixel value of the displayed
subplot in its top left hand corner.  You can use either or both
of these.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The option <TT>full</TT> will cause a full set of plot
annotation to be written at the bottom of each page of the plot.
This includes things like coordinate information, contour levels,
pixel map representation intensity ranges and so on.
