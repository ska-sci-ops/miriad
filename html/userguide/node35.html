Channel Selection, Averaging and Doppler Correction - UV Linetypes
</H1>
Many <I>Miriad</I> tasks support on-the-fly selection and averaging of the
channels to be processed. However, before launching into a description
of this, we will review some <I>Miriad</I> history.
<I>Miriad</I> was originally designed for a telescope which simultaneously
measured both spectral and
continuum data using separate correlators. Spectral data are generally narrowband, and the
<A NAME="1392"></A> <A NAME="1393"></A>
frequencies <A NAME="1394"></A>
are defined to high precision. Doppler tracking is often
employed. Continuum, or wideband, data have a much larger bandwidth, and
frequency
tolerances are not as great.`Channel-0' data (data formed by averaging
all spectral channels together) are also treated as continuum data.

<P>
For ATCA use, there is no real distinction between wideband (continuum)
and spectral data, and the <I>Miriad</I> distinction is not really
relevant. All ATCA data (even channel-0 data) are treated as spectral
data.

<P>
All the same, a <I>Miriad</I> visibility dataset can, in principle,
contain multiple spectral and wideband correlators.
The spectral data is described by a set of `spectral windows' (`IFs' or
`IF channels' in AIPS terminology); each window
consists of a number of channels separated by a fixed increment in
sky frequency (though this increment can vary with time). Similarly there
can be several measured wideband correlations, simply called wideband channels.

<P>
It is quite common, when analysing, plotting or mapping visibility data,
that you will want to perform some averaging and selection of the desired
channels, and you might
wish to examine either the spectral or the wideband data. For the
spectral data, if the channel number does not correspond reasonably directly
with velocity (<I>e.g.</I>
if Doppler tracking was not used), then it might be
desirable to resample the spectral data at equal increments in velocity.

<P>
The ability to select a range of wideband or spectral channels,
to perform averaging, and to resample in velocity is provided by the
`line' parameter - also called the linetype. If your data contain
multiple spectral windows, you should also refer to Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node37.html#s:window">5.6</A>
for more information on spectral channel selection.

<P>
The linetype parameter consists of a string followed by up to four numbers.
Defaults will be used for any trailing part of the linetype specification that
is missing. The string can be one of:
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><TT>channel</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This gives raw or averaged spectral channels. This is
generally the default if spectral data are present. As all ATCA data
are treated as spectral data, this will be the most commonly used
linetype.
<A NAME="1399"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>wide</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This gives raw or averaged wideband (continuum) data.
This is the default if only wideband data are present. Probably this will be
of no interest to ATCA users.
<A NAME="1401"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>velocity</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This gives spectral data, that have been resampled at equal
increments in radio velocity (or equivalently frequency). The resampling operation is a
weighted average
of spectral channels. See Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node131.html#s:veloline">16.8</A> for more information.
<A NAME="1404"></A>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><TT>felocity</TT></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This is like <code>velocity</code>, but allows the velocity
parameters to be given using the optical definition. Note, however,
that the resampling operation is still in equal increments in <EM>frequency (or, equivalently, radio velocity)</EM>. Because of the difference between
the radio and optical velocity definitions, equal increments in radio
velocity are not quite equal in optical velocity, and visa versa.
The velocity increment that you give is used as the optical
velocity increment of the first channel.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The accompanying four numbers are used to specify the range of input channels
selected and averaged to produce the output channels. The four numbers are:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>nchan, start, width, step</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
For <TT>channel</TT> and <TT>wide</TT> linetypes, <I>start, width</I> and <I>step</I>
are channel numbers (channels are numbered from 1 to <I>N</I>), whereas for
<TT>velocity</TT> and <TT>felocity</TT> linetypes these values are in km/s (the velocity is relative
to the rest frame - usually LSR). These values are
<DL>
<DT><STRONG><I>nchan</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>The number of output channels produced. Generally it defaults
to the maximum number of channels that can be produced from the input
data. A value of zero can also be used to give you the default.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>start</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>For <TT>channel</TT> and <TT>wide</TT> linetypes, the <I>start</I> value
is the first input channel to be selected. For <TT>velocity</TT> and <TT>felocity</TT>
linetypes, <I>start</I> is the centre velocity of the first output channel to
be formed. The default value is 1 channel.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>width</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This value determines the width of the selected channels.
For <TT>channel</TT> and <TT>wide</TT> linetypes, this gives the
number of input channels to average together to produce a single output
channel. For <TT>velocity</TT> and <TT>felocity</TT> linetypes,
this gives the velocity width (in km/s) of
the output channels. The default value is again 1 channel.
</DD>
<DT><STRONG><I>step</I></STRONG></DT>
<DD>This parameter gives the increment between channels. For
<TT>channel</TT> and <TT>wide</TT> linetypes, this gives the increment between
selected input channels. For <TT>velocity</TT> and <TT>felocity</TT>
linetype this gives the
velocity increment between the output channels. This defaults to the same
value as <I>width</I>.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
For example
<PRE>
   line=channel,10
</PRE>
selects 10 output channels, being input spectral channels 1 to 10. Similarly
<PRE>
   line=channel,10,8,1,2
</PRE>
again selects 10 output channels, starting at input spectral channel 8, and
skipping every second input channel. If you wanted to average together
every pair of channels (rather than skipping it), you would
use something like
<PRE>
   line=channel,10,8,2,2
</PRE>
Finally a linetype of:
<PRE>
   line=velocity,10,1.5,1.0,3.0
</PRE>
would return 10 `velocity' channels with velocities <EM>centred</EM> at 1.5,
4.5, 7.5, etc. km/s. Each channel would have a width of 1 km/s.

<P>
When using <TT>velocity</TT>, <TT>felocity</TT> or <TT>channel</TT> linetypes on
datasets with multiple spectral windows, <TT>window</TT> selection, as
described in the following sections, may be useful.

<P>
Some tasks require two linetypes, the first being the linetype of the
data, and the second the linetype of a single reference channel
(see <I>e.g.</I> <A NAME="tex2html44"
  HREF="../doc/invert.html">invert</A>). <A NAME="1454"></A> When specifying a reference
linetype, you do not give the <I>nchan</I> (it is always 1) or <I>step</I> (it
makes no sense for a single channel).
