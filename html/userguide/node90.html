Averaging Antenna Gains with Time - GPAVER
</H2>

<P>
If the phase stability is bad during the observation
(the atmospheric conditions are poor), the
phase of the antenna gains can vary rapidly. A change of tens of degrees
or more during the calibrator scan is not uncommon. However the software that
determines the antenna gains assumes that the gains are constant during
a solution interval. So during periods of poor phase stability, it is often
desirable to make the solution interval of the calibration software quite
short. While the resultant gains probably track the phase during the
calibrator scan, what we are really interested in are the antenna gains for the
program
source. If you solved for a number of time intervals during the
calibrator scan, the
best guess at the antenna gains for the program source is derived by
interpolating between some average of the calibrator scan gains.
Thus after determining the gains at a fine time step in the calibrator
scan, you should average these gains together to get some representative
gain for the whole calibrator scan.
This is probably the best guess you can make (at least as far as correcting
the program source is concerned), although in times of truly
awful phase stability, its a pretty poor guess (self-calibration will
be needed in this case).

<P>
There are two ways to average your gains, either  the ``vector'' or ``scalar''
averages. Which is the most appropriate will depend on whether you want
good estimates of the gains or good estimates of the resultant images.

<UL>
<LI>Scalar averaging consists of averaging the amplitude of the gains
separately (the `average' phase is still determined by a traditional
(vector) average of the real and imaginary parts of the gains).
Assuming the
variation in gain is purely due to poor phase stability, a scalar average
will give you a good estimate of the amplitude of the gain.
If you are going to self-calibrate
later, then scalar averages are probably the most appropriate.
This means that
when you come to self-calibrate, you only have to solve for the phase
(at least initially), because you already have a good amplitude estimate.
</LI>
<LI>On the other hand, if you are not going to self-calibrate, you are more
interested in getting a good estimate of your image at this stage, and less
concerned about partially correct gains (the two do not necessarily go hand
in hand). If we
were to use vector averaged antenna gains (averaging the real and imaginary
parts), the poor
phase stability will cause partial decorrelation in both the program
source and calibrator. This will result in
apparent reduced flux densities of both of them. Assuming
that the decorrelation is approximately the same for both, then we could scale
up the program source by the decorrelation that we note in the calibrator.
This can be achieved by vector averaging the antenna gains.
</LI>
</UL>
To summarise the above discussion, when phase stability is poor, it is
best to use a very short solution interval when solving for the antenna
gains of the calibrator scan. The gains during a scan should then be
averaged before applying them to the program source. Scalar averaging is
appropriate if self-calibration is to be used later. Otherwise vector
averaging should be used.

The task <A NAME="tex2html350"
  HREF="../doc/gpaver.html">gpaver</A>
can be used to perform averaging of antenna
gains. Its pretty straightforward.Typical inputs are
