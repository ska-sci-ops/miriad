Introduction</A>
</H1>
The task <A NAME="tex2html358"
  HREF="../doc/invert.html">invert</A>
is used to produce an image (or image cube)
given a collection of visibility datasets.

<P>
Even if you are only interested in continuum imaging, your data may
contain several frequencies. Unless you have averaged over frequency
channels earlier, your data still contains the 33 frequency channels produced
by the ATCA correlator. Additionally as
the ATCA can observe two frequency windows simultaneously, and if these two
windows are relatively close (within about 25% of each other), then you
can get extra sensitivity and improved <I>u-v</I> coverage by combining the
two sets of data during imaging. Indeed you can enhance your <I>u-v</I> coverage
further (but not sensitivity)
by time-switching the frequency setup used, and so you might have
observations at several frequencies, perhaps from different configurations.

<P>
The net result is that you possibly have data observed at multiple frequencies,
and you are faced with the question of how to make an image from these
data. Generally, unless perhaps your observation consists of a single frequency
band at 3 cm, now is <EM>not</EM> the time to do any more averaging. It is
better to let the imaging task, <A NAME="tex2html359"
  HREF="../doc/invert.html">invert</A>, do its job with the
UN-averaged data. By giving <A NAME="tex2html360"
  HREF="../doc/invert.html">invert</A>
data that has not been averaged
in frequency, it can grid the individual channels at their correct location
in the <I>u-v</I> plane (rather than some average location). In this way bandwidth
smearing is reduced and the better
<I>u-v</I> coverage results in a better beam. The advantage of doing this
decrease with
the fractional bandwidth that your data occupies, and so the reasons for
not averaging are less compelling when imaging using a single frequency band
at 3 cm.
In this case, the small disadvantages of not doing the frequency averaging
(somewhat slower run time, and a larger scratch file) might
outweigh the advantages.

<P>
The technique of forming a single continuum image from a variety of
frequencies is called ``multi-frequency synthesis'' (MFS). It produces an
image with a frequency corresponding to some average of the frequencies
of the input data. There is nothing particularly magical about combining
different frequencies to produce a single continuum image. This is done
all the time (interferometers are never monochromatic). The advantage of
MFS is that it can take a greater fractional spread in frequencies before
artifacts become a problem.

<P>
Eventually MFS will break down because of the variation in the sources
flux density with frequency.
If the fractional spread in frequencies is small (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img33.png"
 ALT="$&lt;10\%$"></SPAN>) or if
high dynamic range imaging is not required (dynamic ranges less than a few
hundred or so), then spectral index effects are unimportant. You can
make an MFS image, and deconvolve it using the conventional deconvolution
tasks (if deconvolution is required). Otherwise, spectral index effects are
likely to be important, and you should use a
special task (<A NAME="tex2html361"
  HREF="../doc/mfclean.html">mfclean</A>) for the deconvolution. Note that the decision
to use MFS in the imaging <EM>does not</EM> require you to use <A NAME="tex2html362"
  HREF="../doc/mfclean.html">mfclean</A>
in the deconvolution. While many ATCA continuum observations will benefit
from using MFS in the imaging, a much more select set will benefit from
accounting for spectral index effects in the deconvolution.

<P>
