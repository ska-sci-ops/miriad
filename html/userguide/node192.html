Antenna gain considerations and flux calibration</A>
</H2>
One characteristic of the ATCA dishes is that they are big by 3-mm
standards. Indeed <A NAME="tex2html1034"
  HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1967AJ.....72...35V">van Hoerner (1967)</A>
has considered the limits to the size
of an antenna before various effects become significant.
For construction styles like the ATCA dishes, he suggests that 11m is the
maximum dish size for 3-mm observations before thermal effects become
significant.
As the ATCA dishes are twice this, it is not surprise that the
ATCA antenna gain and primary beam response varies as a result of thermal
distortions. Changes in temperature, the position of the sun, cloudiness and
shadows will all affect the gain of the ATCA antennas. Measurements to
date
tend to bear this out with changes in antenna gain of 25% in some observations
being attributed
to thermal effects.
Distortion of the dishes by gravity is also significant
(eg <A NAME="tex2html1035"
  HREF="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/8/32084/01492610.pdf?tp=&amp;arnumber=1492610&amp;isnumber=32084">Subrahmanyan 2005</A>). 
A gain/elevation
correction will solve this - to first order at least.
Because of the way the ATCA panels are set, the antenna gain peaks at
about 60 degrees elevation. 

<P>
Note that gravitational
and thermal distortions can be coupled - perfect measurement or correction for these
effects is never possible. 

<P>
To first order, the gain change will be calibrated out provided the 
secondary calibrator is very close to the target source.
Applying the standard gain/elevation curve to the data as the first step in
the data reduction will also help.
However these two steps will
not account for changes in the beamshape. This might be an important
effect for widefield imaging and mosaicing.

<P>
The best way to avoid thermally-induced gain variations is by observing
in the pre-dawn hours or on a calm cloudy day. The best way to avoid large
elevation changes in an observation is to observe in a hybrid array - hybrid arrays
allow an observation to be performed without the need to track the source from
horizon to horizon.

<P>
Gain variations must be considered when bootstrapping the flux density 
scale. The best approach to ensuring a good flux scale is to ensure that the
secondary and the flux density calibrator are observed nearly
simultaneously and at the same elevation.
Although this may at first glance sound difficult if not impossible, generally
it is straightforward. Generally there should be a time when the secondary
and the flux
density calibrator are at the same elevation. It may be that one is rising
while the other is setting, and that they are at significantly different parts
of the sky (i.e. significantly different azimuths). Unless the sky is
cloudy, being at different azimuths is not important.
