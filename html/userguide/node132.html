Continuum Subtraction
</H1>

<P>
Spectral line observations will always be ``corrupted'' by some
continuum emission.  If this is stronger or comparable with the spectral
line, then the final spectral images may be dominated by the continuum
and its artifacts (sidelobes, deconvolution errors, calibration errors,
etc).  If the final dynamic range of your image is dominated by
continuum errors, then weak spectral features will be completely
obscured.  It is possible to remove the continuum so that
the final dynamic range of the spectral image is dependent on thermal
noise and artifacts resulting from the spectral line (and <EM>not</EM>
artifacts from the continuum).  Consequently it is usually best to
subtract the continuum from the data.  A good description of the
algorithms to do this is given by
<A NAME="tex2html576"
  HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1992A%26A...258..583C">Cornwell, Uson and Haddad (1992)</A>.
(A&amp;A 258, 583).
Neil Killeen's
<A NAME="tex2html577"
  HREF="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/computing/software/atca_aips/atcal_html.html">``Analysis of Australia Telescope Compact Array Data''</A>
also gives a good summary as well as describing the AIPS possibilities.  The paper <A NAME="tex2html578"
  HREF="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1994A%26AS..107...55S">Sault (1994)</A>
(A&amp;AS 107, 55)
describes one of the algorithms in detail.
Yet another summary is given below.

<P>
Although three approaches to continuum subtraction are possible in <I>Miriad</I>,
we recommend only one of these - the <TT>UVLIN</TT> approach. The other
two are briefly mentioned for completeness:
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><TT>UVSUB</TT>:</DT>
<DD>This is the most time consuming of the techniques, which
involves forming a continuum image from the line-free channels, deconvolving
this and subtracting it from the visibility data-set. In addition to the
normal imaging and deconvolution tasks, <A NAME="tex2html579"
  HREF="../doc/uvmodel.html">uvmodel</A>
will be used to perform
the actual subtraction of the continuum model from the visibility data.
The <TT>options=mfs</TT> switch will be useful in this context.
No more details to this approach will be given here.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><TT>IMLIN</TT>:</DT>
<DD>This is an image-based technique, where a polynomial fit
of the continuum is done along the spectral axis at each pixel in the dirty
image. Although <I>Miriad</I> tasks <A NAME="tex2html580"
  HREF="../doc/contsub.html">contsub</A>
and <A NAME="tex2html581"
  HREF="../doc/avmaths.html">avmaths</A>
can be used to
perform this, no more details will be given here.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><TT>UVLIN</TT>:</DT>
<DD>This is the recommended approach in <I>Miriad</I> to
perform continuum subtraction. It is implemented with the task called
(surprisingly) <A NAME="tex2html582"
  HREF="../doc/uvlin.html">uvlin</A>.

<P>
In this scheme, each visibility spectrum is fitted by a polynomial.
Only the line-free channels of the spectrum are used to determine the fit
The polynomial can be taken to represent the continuum emission, and so
can be subtracted from the spectrum. Because bandwidths in spectral
line experiments are often narrow, the continuum emission is
usually well modelled by a fairly low order polynomial
(zeroth, first or second order).
The fit is performed to the real and imaginary parts of the data separately.
In general, this is better than fitting to the amplitude and phase, as the
whole process remains a linear one. A non-linear fit to amplitude and phase
couples together the errors on all sources, and produces an amplitude
bias at low signal-to-noise ratios.

<P>
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The main advantage of <TT>UVLIN</TT> over the other two approaches is that
it is generally the most robust to a large variety of systematic errors
(such as antenna gain errors). <TT>IMLIN</TT> is also moderately robust to these
errors, whereas <TT>UVSUB</TT> is not particularly robust at all. <TT>UVLIN</TT>,
along with <TT>IMLIN</TT>, is substantially less expensive computationally
than <TT>UVSUB</TT>,
and they generally requires less care and intervention on the part of
the user.

<P>
<TT>UVLIN</TT>, however, is not perfect. There will be some residual continuum
left behind, and the noise level in the output will be amplified in those
channels that were excluded from the fitting process. These drawbacks
are not unique to <TT>UVLIN</TT> - they will be a characteristic of any
continuum subtraction technique.
There are three parameters to control <TT>UVLIN</TT> -
the set of channels to be
used in the fitting process (i.e. the set of channels that are assumed
to be line-free), the order of the polynomial to fit and an offset to be
applied to the data before the fit
is performed. The combination of these three parameters will determine
the residual continuum. They also determine the factor by which the noise
level increases in the data. We clearly want to keep this noise amplification
to an acceptable level.

<P>
Usually we have little direct control over the channels that
are line-free. Obviously, though, the more line-free channels we have,
the better the fitting process will be. <EM>Do not discard any
line-free channels until after continuum subtraction.</EM>

<P>
If there are line-free channels on only one side of the spectrum (i.e.
you have to extrapolate the continuum fit), then generally it is unwise
to use anything but a 0th order fit. This is because the residual continuum
is not greatly affected by the fit order, whereas noise amplification can
become extreme.

<P>
On the other hand, if there are line-free channels on both sides of the
spectrum, and provided the fraction of channels involved in the fitting
process is appreciable (at least 25%), then higher order fits are quite
useful. The residual continuum depends on the continuum source flux
density and the parameter <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

Because of the narrow bandwidth of most spectral line experiments,
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="42" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img87.png"
 ALT="$\eta &lt; 1$"></SPAN>, and so the residual continuum decreases rapidly as the fit
order is increased. A zeroth or first order fit will be quite adequate for many
spectral line experiments. Given a continuum image, the task <A NAME="tex2html583"
  HREF="../doc/conterr.html">conterr</A>
can determine images which should be indicative of the residual. There should
<EM>not</EM> be viewed as strict error images. Rather they indicate the magnitude
and location of the residual errors.

<P>
As the fit order is increased, noise amplification also increases.
Generally, provided we have a significant
number of line-free channels (and you are not extrapolating) the noise
amplification is modest. You should be cautious of noise amplification
for fourth order fits if fewer than 50% of the channels are
line-free, or for third order fits when fewer than 25% of the channels are
line-free. <I>Miriad</I> task <A NAME="tex2html584"
  HREF="../doc/contsen.html">contsen</A>
can be used to determine the noise
amplification given the fitting order and the channels included in the
fitting process.

<P>
The fact that the residual continuum is a function of the distance of
the point source from the phase centre should not be a surprise.  As
<I>u-v</I> coordinate is proportional to frequency, the channels in a
visibility spectrum are sampling slightly different locations in the
<I>u-v</I> plane.  For a point source (which we assume to have a spectral
index of zero, for simplicity) will have a visibility function whose
real and imaginary parts are sinusoids.  The fraction of a period of
this sinusoid contained within the <I>u-v</I> coordinates spanned by a
visibility spectrum will be directly proportional to the distance of the
point source from the phase centre.  The further the point source is
from the phase centre, the greater proportion of a sinusoid period is
present in the visibility spectrum, and the poorer the approximation of
the visibility spectrum by a low order polynomial.

<P>
This leads us to another way of reducing the residual continuum - we
can shift the phase centre to the location of the continuum source.
The amount of benefit derived from such a shift will depend strongly
on the skewness of the distribution of the continuum, and its distance
from the phase centre. The task <A NAME="tex2html585"
  HREF="../doc/conterr.html">conterr</A>
can suggest shifts
which will minimise the error (see <TT>options=shift</TT>).
