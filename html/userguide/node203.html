Bandpass and antenna gain calibration</A>
</H2>
When calibrating 3-mm data, it is possible to use a similar
approach as with lower frequency data  - see
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node73.html#c:cal">11</A>. In this case, because polarimetry is not currently
possible with the 3-mm system, only task <A NAME="tex2html1051"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>
is needed
to perform bandpass and antenna calibration. Flux density bootstrapping
can be accomplished using <A NAME="tex2html1052"
  HREF="../doc/mfboot.html">mfboot</A>
described below.

<P>
However, the recommended approach at 3mm is different from this.
As noted in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node194.html#s:weakcal">23.1.4</A>, calibration at 3mm is more
difficult because of weak calibrators, poorer system sensitivity and
more challenging atmospheric conditions. This section outlines an
alternative calibration approach exploiting the dual frequency bands of the
ATCA. The steps are as follows:

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The first step is not a step at all! Unlike the approach of
Chapter&nbsp;<A HREF="node73.html#c:cal">11</A>, the approach described here <I>does not</I> split the 
data into separate single source, single frequency files before
calibration. Rather the 
current approach assumes that you have a single <I>Miriad</I> dataset containing
bandpass calibrator, secondary calibrator, flux density calibrator and 
target source. We focus on data having two simultaneous frequency bands
here, but the approach works equally well for one or many simultaneous
frequency bands within the dataset.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The first real step is akin to a bandpass calibration step. When
dealing with two frequency bands, each with two polarisation products
(XX and YY), it is
generally appropriate to
assume that the bandpasses of the bands and the phase offsets between
bands and polarisations are constant with time. 

<P>
To determine the bandpasses and the phase offsets, you need
to use <A NAME="tex2html1053"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>
on an observation of a strong continuum source.
Typically this would be 
1253-055, 1921-293 or 0537-441. 
Typical inputs are as follows:

<P>
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3 BORDER="1">
<TR><TD ALIGN="CENTER" COLSPAN=2><SPAN><B>MFCAL</B></SPAN></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">in=vela.fixed.uv</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Input multi-source, dual-band dataset.</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT">select=source(1921-293)</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">Select the strong continuum ``bandpass'' calibrator.</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
The important output of this step is a bandpass calibration table which
will contain the relevant phase offsets. The output also contains
antenna gain calibration tables, but this will be overwritten below.

<P>
In doing this step, you may well want to avoid using some edge
channels in the bandpass calibration process. To achieve this, you
can use the <TT>edge</TT> parameter of <A NAME="tex2html1054"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>. The <TT>edge</TT> parameter
sets the number of channels to drop for all bands equally. It does not
allow you to set different number of channels to drop in the different bands.
If the channels and bandwidth characteristics of the different bands differ
significantly, the <TT>edge</TT> parameter probably does not give you
sufficient flexibility. In this case, you could use <A NAME="tex2html1055"
  HREF="../doc/uvflag.html">uvflag</A>
to
explicitly flag edge channels.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The next step is to determine the antenna gain calibration, again
using <A NAME="tex2html1056"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>. To do this,
you will want to select those data for the secondary calibrator which
will give the best overall sensitivity appropriate to your observation.

<UL>
<LI>If the calibrator is a continuum source, you need only select this
source and use both bands. Task <A NAME="tex2html1057"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>
will weight the two bands
according to their relative bandwidth. Consequently if one of the bands
is quite narrow relative to the other, then it will contribute little to
the overall gain solution.
</LI>
<LI>If the calibrator is an SiO maser, you will want to select only those
channels that contain strong SiO signal. 
</LI>
<LI>With either a continuum calibrator or an SiO maser, it is possible to
either determine antenna gain calibrations for the two polarisation products 
independently, or to determine a
single joint solution for the two polarisations. The latter will give
a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img32.png"
 ALT="$\sqrt{2}$"></SPAN> improvement in sensitivity in the solution process.
The latter is also the
desirable approach if the calibrator is strongly polarised (some SiO 
masers are more than 50% polarised). Doing a joint solution is
generally a reasonable approximation given that the antenna gains
are dominated by changes common to both polarisations: in amplitude, it is
from the physical antenna 
gain change, and in phase it is from the atmosphere and instrumental 
contributions common to both polarisations.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Note in this calibration scheme, it is implicitly assumed that the antenna 
gain changes are common to both frequency bands. This is a reasonable
approximation given that the frequency separation between the bands is
at most 2.7 GHz and potentially much less. Consequently the fractional
frequency separation in at most a few percent, and so the calibration change
between bands can be assumed to be minimal.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Typical inputs for <A NAME="tex2html1058"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>
follow. This assumes a continuum
source as the secondary calibrator and does a joiubt solution for the
two polarisations:

</DIV>
To derive a separate solution for the two polarisation products, the
<TT>stokes</TT> keyword would be left unset. Note the use of <code>options=nopassol</code>.
This causes <A NAME="tex2html1059"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>
to not attempt to solve for the
bandpass and phase offsets again, but rather to apply the previously 
determined bandpass and phase offset solutions.

<P>
Typical inputs when using an SiO maser would be as follows:
