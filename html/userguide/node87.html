Calibration</A>
</H1>
You are now ready to start the main calibration step. You
should have a large number of <I>Miriad</I> datasets, each containing
a single frequency band and source. The calibration process will
determine bandpass functions (assuming you have not already averaged your
data into a channel-0 dataset) and antenna gains as a function of time.
If you have measured all four polarisation products, the process will also
determine
instrumental polarisation and the polarisation of the secondary calibrator.
Assuming you have observations of
the primary flux density calibrator, 1934-638, a secondary phase
calibrator, and
your program source, there are two avenues open to you. The first,
sketched in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:polcal2">12.2</A>, uses the secondary to determine
all the calibration quantities except the absolute flux density scale. The
primary is used to determine the absolute flux density scale, and is
generally used to double check the other quantities. While this avenue is
the preferred path, it requires good parallactic
angle coverage of the secondary to disentangle the instrumental polarisation
and the secondary calibrator polarisation. For typical secondary calibrator
flux densities, it also requires a modest amount of integration time
to determine the bandpass to good accuracy.

<P>
The second avenue is to rely on the observation of the primary
calibrator, 1934-638, to determine instrumental polarisation and bandpass
function. This is possible as 1934-638 is strong, and its polarisation
is known (it is less than 0.2% polarised). This approach is shown
in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:polcal3">12.3</A>. Note that this approach relies on knowing
the polarisation of 1934-638. This approach cannot be used if an
alternative primary calibrator is used.

We start by calibrating 1934-638. Assuming that you have not
averaged the data into a channel-0 dataset, we start with bandpass
calibration. The task to perform this is <A NAME="tex2html304"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>. After having
solved for the bandpass function, <A NAME="tex2html305"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>
writes a bandpass
table in the visibility dataset - the data themselves are not
modified. Although it
is possible for <A NAME="tex2html306"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>
to cope with datasets which contain
multiple IF bands, and which frequency switch with time, we recommend
that you <EM>do not</EM> use this feature. It is easier to stick with
datasets with a single frequency band.

<P>
As well as determining a bandpass function, <A NAME="tex2html307"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>
determines
antenna gains. These gains are based upon the assumption that
the source is unpolarised (which happens to be true for 1934-638) and that
the instrumental polarisation is zero (which is not true). While these
assumptions do not affect the quality of the bandpass, and provided you
have measured all four polarisation correlations, it is best to follow the
run of <A NAME="tex2html308"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>
with task <A NAME="tex2html309"
  HREF="../doc/gpcal.html">gpcal</A>
to correctly determine
instrumental polarisation. The task <A NAME="tex2html310"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>
is described more
completely in Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node79.html#s:mfcal">11.4</A>

<P>
If your data are to be combined (or compared) with pre-August 1994 ATCA data,
you will probably also use the <TT>oldflux</TT>
option (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node93.html#s:1934flux">12.6</A>).

Skip this step if you have measured only the <I>XX</I> and <I>YY</I> correlations.
We now proceed
to determine the antenna gains and instrumental
polarisation from the primary calibrator. Task <A NAME="tex2html311"
  HREF="../doc/gpcal.html">gpcal</A>
is used
for this (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node80.html#s:gpcal">11.5</A> for more information). Task <A NAME="tex2html312"
  HREF="../doc/gpcal.html">gpcal</A>
will generally use the bandpass determined by <A NAME="tex2html313"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>
to partially correct
the data. When calibrating 1934-638, the only options that you
will normally turn on is for the <I>XY</I> phases to be solved for as a function
of time; <code>options=xyvary</code>.
If your data are to be combined (or compared) with pre-August 1994 ATCA data,
you will probably also use the <TT>oldflux</TT>
option (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node93.html#s:1934flux">12.6</A>).
Typical parameters for calibrating 1934-638 are thus

<P>
Task <A NAME="tex2html314"
  HREF="../doc/gpcal.html">gpcal</A>
will report the instrumental polarisation parameters
(leakages) - two complex numbers per feed. Typically these are 1 to 2%,
although they can be 4% under bad conditions. Typically these are quite
constant with time, with similar values resulting from observations
several months apart. However they are modestly frequency dependent.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Calibration of 1934-638 is
now complete. You should examine the calibration solutions for
reasonableness.
Generally the bandpass function will have an amplitude
of 1, plus or minus 15%, and phase of a few degrees. Provided you equalised
the gains at the start of your observation, your antenna gains
should have an amplitude close to 1, although the phases should reflect
atmospheric phase stability. If you see glitches in the antenna gains
in time, it
is probably due to bad data. Go back and look at the data near this
time, and perhaps do some more flagging - see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node62.html#s:uvflag">10.1</A>.

<P>
Tasks appropriate to examine the effectiveness of the calibration are
<A NAME="tex2html315"
  HREF="../doc/uvplt.html">uvplt</A>
(to generate plots of the calibrated data - remember that many
<I>Miriad</I> tasks apply any available calibration by default) and <A NAME="tex2html316"
  HREF="../doc/gpplt.html">gpplt</A>
(to generate plots of the calibration tables - both antenna gains
and bandpass functions). A particularly useful plot is the ``scatter diagram''

<P>
This scatter diagram should show four concentrations of points - one for
<I>I</I> at the flux density of the calibrator, and the others for <I>Q</I>, <I>U</I> and <I>V</I>
probably
near zero. If there are outliers, you probably need to do some more flagging.
If you see arcs, the phase calibration is probably bad - you might try
decreasing the solution interval.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>We now come to calibrating the secondary calibrator, and there are
three possible approaches to follow:

<UL>
<LI>If you have multi-channel data for the secondary (i.e. not channel-0),
but you do not have sufficient observations on the secondary to determine a bandpass
from it, you must use the second approach (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:polcal3">12.3</A> and
step 6 below).
</LI>
<LI>If you have measured all four polarisation correlations and if you
have poor parallactic angle coverage of the secondary,
you must use the second approach (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:polcal3">12.3</A> and step 6).
</LI>
<LI>Otherwise you have sufficient data to use your secondary to
determine the appropriate calibration parameters, and you can use the first
approach (Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:polcal2">12.2</A> and step 5).
</LI>
<LI>There is a third, hybrid, approach, which determines the bandpass from
the primary and the polarisation characteristics from the secondary. Although
this approach is no more complicated than the other two, we leave it as
an exercise for the reader to determine the correct sequence.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Good parallactic angle coverage enables you to disentangle the instrumental
and secondary polarisations from each other. ``Good coverage'' generally means
more than a few cuts. For sources near declination of -30 degrees, the
parallactic angle remains constant through much of the observation, except near
transit where it goes through a rapid change, whereas for sources near the
poles, parallactic angle changes linearly with time.
You can plot your parallactic angle coverage using the
task <A NAME="tex2html318"
  HREF="../doc/varplt.html">varplt</A>. More strictly, it plots the angle between the
sky and the feed (i.e. parallactic angle plus 45 degrees for the
ATCA).

<LI><EM>If you have sufficient secondary data:</EM>
If you have not already averaged
the data into a channel-0 dataset, you should determine the bandpass
calibration of the secondary. This is identical to the determining the bandpass
calibration for the primary, except that the flux density, and its
variation with frequency, will generally not be known for the secondary.
In this case <A NAME="tex2html319"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>
assumes a spectral index of 0 and a flux density to
make the rms antenna gains equal to 1. Again, if the atmospheric phase stability
is good, set the solution interval to the scan length. Otherwise, provided
the source is moderately strong, set the
solution interval to a small value. Typical input parameters are

<A NAME="3301"></A>
Skip the remainder of this step if you have only measured <I>XX</I> and <I>YY</I>
correlations, as the
gains determined by <A NAME="tex2html320"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>
are as good as you can do. Otherwise
we now come to solving for instrumental polarisation and the polarisation
of the secondary itself. Given good parallactic angle coverage, these
can be disentangled. For a given correlation, the instrumental polarisation
terms stay constant with time, whereas
the polarisation due to the source vary as sinusoids of the parallactic angle.
Inputs to <A NAME="tex2html321"
  HREF="../doc/gpcal.html">gpcal</A>
are similar to the case of the primary, with
the very significant exception that we must turn on the switch to solve for
the secondary's polarisation. The appropriate
options to do this are <TT>options=qusolve,xyvary</TT>. As with <A NAME="tex2html322"
  HREF="../doc/mfcal.html">mfcal</A>, the
flux density of the secondary will generally not be known, so <A NAME="tex2html323"
  HREF="../doc/gpcal.html">gpcal</A>
determines a flux density so that the rms antenna gains are 1. Again
the <TT>interval</TT> parameter should be set to the calibrator scan length
if the phase stability is good. If this is not so, then it should be set to
a smaller value (1 to 0.1 minutes) with the caveats as noted in the
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node79.html#s:mfcal">11.4</A> above. If you do set it so a small value,
there is an additional step (and decision) to be performed before you can
interpolate the gain solutions onto your program source - see
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node90.html#s:gpaver">12.4</A>.

Typical inputs for this case are

In the unlikely chance that your calibrator turns out to be more than
about 5% polarised, you may wish to run <A NAME="tex2html324"
  HREF="../doc/gpcal.html">gpcal</A>
again, but this
time you should add options <code>xyref</code> and <code>polref</code>. This will solve
for an <I>XY</I> phase offset on the reference antenna, as well as an
instrumental polarisation characteristic that cannot be determined from
a weakly polarised source.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><EM>If you have little secondary data:</EM>
If you have poor parallactic angle coverage of your secondary
and/or there are insufficient observations of the
secondary to determine a bandpass solution, then it is best to
rely on the instrumental polarisation and bandpass calibration
determined from 1934-638. The
suggested approach, sketched in Figure&nbsp;<A HREF="#fig:polcal3">12.3</A>, is to copy the
instrumental polarisation parameters (if present) and bandpass from 1934-648
to your secondary, and then solve for the antenna gains. Additionally
if all four polarisation correlations were measure, the polarisation of
the secondary is also solved for.

<P>
The task to copy the instrumental polarisation and bandpass function is
<A NAME="tex2html325"
  HREF="../doc/gpcopy.html">gpcopy</A>. The inputs are very simple for this situation - you give it
the names of the input and output datasets. For example

This will also copy the antenna gains determined for 1934-638 - this is
unimportant as we will now overwrite them by rerunning <A NAME="tex2html326"
  HREF="../doc/gpcal.html">gpcal</A>. We
want to solve for antenna gains and the <I>XY</I> phases as a function of time.
Additionally, if we have measured all four polarisation correlations, we want
to solve for the polarisation of the secondary.
We <EM>do not</EM> have enough data to solve for
instrumental and secondary polarisation simultaneously, so we turn off
the solver for instrumental polarisation.
The relevant options are
thus <TT>options=xyvary,qusolve,nopol</TT> if all four polarisation correlations
were measured, and <TT>options=xyvary,nopol</TT> if only <I>XX</I> and <I>YY</I> were
measured. Again the solution
interval should be either the scan length (for observations with good
phase stability) or set to a small value (if phase stability
is poor). Typical inputs are

  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>, then the
theoretical scatter printed by <A NAME="tex2html334"
  HREF="../doc/uvflux.html">uvflux</A>
is a factor of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="25" HEIGHT="37" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img32.png"
 ALT="$\sqrt{2}$"></SPAN>
higher than the true theoretical value. This is as, for this correlator
configuration (and not for others), individual channels are not independent -
they overlap by a factor of exactly 2 (in noise bandwidth). Task <A NAME="tex2html335"
  HREF="../doc/uvflux.html">uvflux</A>
fails to take account of this. The second and third numeric columns
are the mean visibility
amplitude and phase. The phase should be near 0 for <I>I</I>, but could be either
0 or 180 degrees for <I>Q</I> and <I>U</I> (assuming there is signal in these!).
<I>V</I> should be noise. The fourth
column gives the actual scatter. This should be close to the theoretical
value. Do not be concerned if it is a factor of 2 or so bigger. If it is
more than a factor of a few greater than the theoretical, you probably
still have bad data or a bad gain solution.

<P>
Using <A NAME="tex2html336"
  HREF="../doc/uvplt.html">uvplt</A>
to plot the calibrated data is also recommended. As
with the primary, a scatter diagram plot is quite useful and quick.

<P>
Outliers in the scatter diagram probably indicate bad data - you might
want to go back and flag some more, and redo some calibration steps. Note,
however, that the ultimate objective of the calibration process is to get
good calibration solutions - you are not attempting to produce perfect
primary or secondary calibrator data. If you do not believe that outliers
affect the calibration solutions unduly, ignore them.

<P>
Another check is to plot the gain solutions and inspect them for
consistency - use <A NAME="tex2html337"
  HREF="../doc/gpplt.html">gpplt</A>
for this (see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node82.html#s:gpplt">11.7</A>).
Typical inputs for plotting the solved-for <I>XY</I>
phases are given below. These <I>XY</I> phases are the difference between the
actual <I>XY</I> phases and the <I>XY</I> phase correction applied by <A NAME="tex2html338"
  HREF="../doc/atlod.html">atlod</A>.
These should be constant (within the noise) and no more than a few degrees.

<P>
In addition to plotting these solved-for <I>XY</I> phases, it is probably worth
while plotting antenna and bandpass gains and phases. If you see glitches
in the solutions, check the data again. This might be due to bad data
or interference. You might do some more flagging, and redo some of the
calibration again.

<P>
A final check is to compare the instrumental polarisation solution
(the leakage parameters). You can compare these with another independently
derived set of these solutions. These solutions are moderately time
independent (they are moderately consistent over months), although there
is significant frequency variation. The independent set of solutions
may have come from the primary (e.g. if you determined instrumental polarisation
for the primary and secondary independently - which was recommended if
you had sufficient parallactic angle coverage), or from a previous
configuration, or possibly other secondary calibrators from the same
observing run. The task to compare the different solutions is <A NAME="tex2html339"
  HREF="../doc/gpnorm.html">gpnorm</A>.
Apart from just taking some sort of difference between two sets of parameters,
it adjusts certain parameters to minimise the difference. The parameters
that it adjusts are the absolute feed orientation and ellipticity - two
quantities that are not solved for in the preceding calibration process
(unless you had a strongly polarised calibrator, and used <TT>options=polref</TT>
in <A NAME="tex2html340"
  HREF="../doc/gpcal.html">gpcal</A>). Task <A NAME="tex2html341"
  HREF="../doc/gpnorm.html">gpnorm</A>
can also deduce an error in the
absolute <I>XY</I> phase between the two observations (an error in the absolute
<I>XY</I> phase leaves a signature in the instrumental polarisation parameters).

<P>
Task <A NAME="tex2html342"
  HREF="../doc/gpnorm.html">gpnorm</A>
reports three numbers - an <I>XY</I> phase offset, the
offset in absolute orientation and ellipticity, and a residual rms error.
As the preceding calibration process should have corrected for the <I>XY</I>
phase offset, this should be no more than a few degrees. The offset in
absolute orientation and ellipticity should be no more than 2-3%.
The rms residual error should be no more than 0.005. You would
expect the agreement to degrade with time difference in the observations
used to derive the parameters. Agreement should be very good for
parameters derived from observations on the same day, whereas agreement
should be less good for observations several months apart.

<P>
Having solved for an offset in absolute <I>XY</I> phase, orientation and
ellipticity, <A NAME="tex2html343"
  HREF="../doc/gpnorm.html">gpnorm</A>
can ``correct'' the calibration tables
for these. This is generally not advisable.

Having produced a good set of calibration tables for the secondary, all
that remains is to correct for the flux density of the secondary calibrator.
The task to do this is <A NAME="tex2html345"
  HREF="../doc/gpboot.html">gpboot</A>.
Recall that the flux density of the secondary was determined by assuming that
the rms gain amplitude was 1. This assumption will be in error, although if
the gains were equalised before the observation (which is the normal practice),
the error will typically be small. Only a small adjustment needs to be made.
Given that we know the flux density of the primary, the correction for the
secondary's flux density can be determined. Then the gains of the secondary
can be corrected to reflect the true flux density of the secondary.

<P>
In principle, you should use observations of the secondary and primary
calibrators that were taken at the same time and elevation. For obvious
reasons this is not possible. However, you can use the <TT>select</TT> keyword
to select data from the secondary when it was as close as possible to the
primary's elevation when it was observed.

<P>
Task <A NAME="tex2html346"
  HREF="../doc/gpboot.html">gpboot</A>
can optionally correct the <I>XY</I> phases of the
secondary, assuming that the <I>XY</I> phases of the primary are correct,
and that the <I>XY</I> phases are constant.  Given <I>XY</I> phase strategy
that you should have already followed, this is not recommended.
