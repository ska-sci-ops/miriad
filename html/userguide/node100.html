Introduction</A>
</H1>
Because synthesis arrays sample the <I>u-v</I> plane at discrete locations, there is
incomplete knowledge about the Fourier transform of the source intensity
distribution.   The measured visibility data can be thought of as the true
distribution, <I>V(u,v)</I>, in the <I>u-v</I> plane multiplied by some sampling function,
<I>S(u,v)</I>.    The convolution theorem states that the Fourier transform of
the sampled distribution (the dirty image, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="23" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img37.png"
 ALT="$I_D$"></SPAN>) is equal to the convolution of
the Fourier transform of the true source visibility distribution (the true image,
<I>I</I>) and the Fourier transform of the sampling function (the dirty beam,

<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

the Fourier transform.  Deconvolution algorithms attempt to account for
the UN-sampled regions of the <I>u-v</I> plane.  If it was fully sampled, there
would be no sidelobes, since the sampling function would be a constant,
and the Fourier transform of a constant is a delta function; a perfect
beam.  Thus, deconvolution tries to remove the sidelobes of the dirty
beam that are present in the image.  It is important to realize that in
doing so, the algorithm is guessing at what the visibilities are in the
UN-sampled part of the <I>u-v</I> plane.  The solution to the convolution
equation is not unique, and the problem of image reconstruction is
reduced to that of choosing a plausible image from the set of possible
solutions.

<P>
You should be extremely cautious when deconvolving images formed from a
small number of snapshots.  In these cases, there will be large areas of
the <I>u-v</I> plane that are unsampled because of the poor instantaneous <I>u-v</I>
coverage of the ATCA.  If the source is complicated, the deconvolution
algorithm may go badly wrong in its guess of what the source really
looks like in the gaps.  The best way to make a decent image of an
object is to observe it, not to allow a deconvolution algorithm to guess
what it looks like.

<P>
If you are using multi-frequency synthesis (MFS) in a situation where spectral index
effects are
significant (i.e. when the fractional spread in frequencies is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="50" HEIGHT="32" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img42.png"
 ALT="$&gt;10\%$"></SPAN> and/or
images with dynamic ranges better than a few hundred are required), then
the simple convolution relationship no longer applies - see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node110.html#s:mfclean">14.4</A>.

<P>
There are two techniques used commonly in radio astronomy; CLEAN and
maximum entropy (MEM).  CLEAN is rarely used outside of radio astronomy,
but MEM is more far reaching.  For detailed discussion on the `pros'
and `cons' of these algorithms, see the NRAO imaging workshops and
references therein.  Much blood has been spilt over their relative
merits in the last decade or so.

<P>
It is probably fair to say that in general, CLEAN is easier to drive than MEM,
although using MEM can result in reduced processing times for large problems.
All dirty images produced by <A NAME="tex2html392"
  HREF="../doc/invert.html">invert</A>
(continuum, line, MFS, any Stokes
parameters)
can be deconvolved with either <A NAME="tex2html393"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>
(CLEAN) or <A NAME="tex2html394"
  HREF="../doc/maxen.html">maxen</A>
(MEM).
However to deconvolve an MFS image where spectral index effects are important,
a special version of CLEAN is used, <A NAME="tex2html395"
  HREF="../doc/mfclean.html">mfclean</A>.

<P>
After the deconvolution is finished, you have produced a the model of the
source. CLEAN produces a CLEAN component image (a collection of delta
functions), whereas MEM produces some more smooth model. The output images
of both CLEAN and MEM are in units of Jy/pixel, and are super-resolved
(i.e. they contain spatial frequencies beyond those measured).
Looking at the CLEAN component image is a sobering
experience.  While the MEM output is more visually appealing, it will generally
contain a positive bias. To improve the qualitative appearance of the models
produced by the deconvolution tasks, and to
suppress what is essentially unmeasured high spatial frequency structure,
it is common (essentially universal with CLEAN) to follow the
deconvolution by a `restore' step.  This step involves convolving the model
sky with a Gaussian.  This convolved image is then added to
the residual image.  The Gaussian is chosen to match the main lobe of
the dirty beam, and it is generally called the CLEAN beam (regardless of
whether CLEAN or MEM was used) or the restoring beam.
