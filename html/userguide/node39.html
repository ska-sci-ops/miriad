Polarization/Stokes Handling (stokes and select)
</H1>
The visibility datasets possibly contain correlations for different polarizations
and Stokes parameters. There are two basic ways that polarization
<A NAME="1677"></A>
characteristics can be measured: firstly, two orthogonal feeds can be
present on the <A NAME="1678"></A>
antennas, and the four different polarization correlations from a baseline can
be taken and recorded. Alternatively only one feed may be present, which can
be rotated, or there are not enough correlators to calculate all four
polarization correlations simultaneously. The first approach, used by the ATCA,
allows all
polarization parameters to be measured simultaneously. The second forces
a `time-sharing' approach, where the feed or correlator must be switched
between measuring one polarization to another. With the four simultaneous
measurements, it is possible to convert a visibility from raw polarization
parameter to a Stokes parameter. With the time-shared mode, this is not
directly possible. These two different scenarios mean that two very different
suites of software are needed to obtain Stokes parameters.

<P>
In <I>Miriad</I>, each different polarization/Stokes measurement is treated as a
separate visibility (this differs from the AIPS approach - which does
not really support the time-shared approach to polarization measurement).
So if a baseline measures four simultaneous polarization correlations, then
four `visibilities' will be produced for this baseline, per integration
interval. In this case, each visibility will be tagged (with a <I>u-v</I> variable
<TT>pol</TT>) to indicate the polarization type.

<P>
There are two ways the user can determine which polarizations he or she
wants to process, either with the <TT>select</TT> parameter, or with the
<TT>stokes</TT> parameter.

<P>
The <TT>select</TT> approach selects visibilities purely on the basis of their
polarization or Stokes parameter.
It is a normal part of the <I>u-v</I> selection process, as described in the
previous section. The <TT>select</TT> mechanism cannot
convert from raw polarization parameters to Stokes parameters. It just
selects visibilities, in the file, based on their polarization.
The general form is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>select=polarization(</TT><I>a,b,c,...</I><TT>)</TT>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <I>a,b,c</I> etc can be one of the mnemonics

<UL>
<LI>For Stokes parameters: <TT>i, q, u, v</TT>
</LI>
<LI>For circular polarization parameters: <TT>rr, ll, rl, lr </TT>
</LI>
<LI>For linear polarization parameters: <TT>xx, yy, xy and yx</TT>
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Using the <TT>stokes</TT> approach is superficially similar, in that it causes
only certain polarization/Stokes parameters to be processed. However,
with the <TT>stokes</TT> approach, the software can perform
conversion between raw polarizations and Stokes parameters if required.
It also insists that all the requested polarization/Stokes parameters are
calculable, at a given time, before it will allow any of them to be
processed.
For example, if the user requests Stokes  I and V, and the
dataset contains linear polarization data, then all four of
<TT>xx, yy, xy</TT> and <TT>yx</TT>
polarizations must be present for I and V to be returned.

<P>
The general form of the <TT>stokes</TT> approach is:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<TT>stokes=</TT><I>a,b,c,...</I>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
where <I>a,b,c</I> etc, can be one of the mnemonics given above
(<TT>i, q, u, v, rr, ll</TT> etc).

<P>
The <TT>stokes</TT> can also take the values <TT>ii, qq</TT> and
<TT>uu</TT>:

<UL>
<LI>Mnemonic <TT>ii</TT> returns Stokes-I <EM>given the assumption that the
source is unpolarised</EM>. For example <I>Miriad</I> would not return any data
if you requested <code>stokes=i</code> and the dataset contains only, say, <TT>xx</TT> (<TT>xx</TT>
is not Stokes-I for a polarised source). How if you requested <code>stokes=ii</code>
in this situation, the <TT>xx</TT> data would be passed through, because
you have told <I>Miriad</I> that the source is unpolarised. Many tasks use
<code>stokes=ii</code> as their default.
</LI>
<LI>Mnemonic <TT>qq</TT> and <TT>uu</TT> returns Stokes-Q and Stokes-U <EM>given the assumption that the parallactic angle is 0</EM>. These quantities
are rarely of astronomical interest, but they are useful to investigate some
instrumental effects.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
The <TT>select</TT> mechanism is usually used for time-shared polarization
measurements, whereas the <TT>stokes</TT> mechanism is usually used where there are
simultaneous measurements. However this is not a hard and fast rule.
The two approaches generally cannot be used at the
same time. Some tasks will prohibit the use of the <TT>select</TT>
approach altogether (they will give error messages if you attempt to),
whereas others are more lenient. The rules which determine whether you
can or cannot use the <TT>select</TT> approach are quite arcane and can be
file dependent. Check the documentation for each task,
especially if both <TT>select</TT> and <TT>stokes</TT> parameters are present.
If <TT>polarization</TT> selection is not allowed, then <TT>increment</TT>
selection will also be prohibited (due to some arcane quirk).
