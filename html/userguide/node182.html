Some Theory and Preparing the Single-Dish Data</A>
</H2>
Both the linear and non-linear methods require a mosaic and a single-dish
image as inputs. <I>Miriad</I> has not tasks to form images from
single-dish data. Thus you must use another package to generate the
single-dish image, which you will then import into <I>Miriad</I> (presumably
via FITS - see Section&nbsp;<A HREF="node47.html#s:fits">8.2</A>). Further massaging might then be
needed within <I>Miriad</I> to prepare the single-dish image for the combination
process. The steps needed are as follows:

<OL>
<LI>Coordinate grids: The coordinate systems of the single-dish and
mosaic image <EM>must be identical</EM>. That is the image size, pixel
increment, equinox, projection geometry, etc, must be the same.
Often, the <A NAME="tex2html953"
  HREF="../doc/regrid.html">regrid</A>
task can achieve this reasonably painlessly. Given an input image and a
template image, <A NAME="tex2html954"
  HREF="../doc/regrid.html">regrid</A>
resamples (by interpolation)
the input onto the grid of the template.
In doing so, it correctly handles different projection geometries,
equatorial/galactic coordinate conversion, equinox conversion and different
velocity definitions.

<P>
Note you should not regrid the mosaiced image. In regridding, the information
that describes the mosaicing process is lost, which will make life difficult
for you.

<P>
Typical inputs to <A NAME="tex2html955"
  HREF="../doc/regrid.html">regrid</A>
would be

</TABLE>
</DIV>

<P>
For interpolation to produce a faithful output, the grid of the
input cannot be too coarse - the number of pixels across the single-dish
beam should be at least 3. Although this is usually readily satisfied on the
spatial axes, spectral line users should be more wary: the number of channels
across the spectral axis response function is usually very small. In addition,
whereas the spatial resolution of the single dish will be poorer than the
mosaic, this is not necessarily true for the spectral axis. So, in addition
to regridding, some spectral smearing might need to be performed to reduce
the spectral resolution of the single-dish image to that of the mosaic.
Unfortunately, <I>Miriad</I> is poorly equipped to solve these problems; these
issues are left as a difficult exercise for the user.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Flux scale calibration:
The single-dish and mosaic images both should have flux units of Jy/beam. 
Although appropriate calibration during the observations is obviously the 
best method to ensuring that the flux scales of the mosaic and 
single-dish images are the same, this is not always
achieved. The flux scales of two images, that are nominally in the same units,
can differ by a modest, but appreciable, amount. 

<P>
A common approach to estimating flux calibration factor is to compare the
single-dish and mosaic images in that annulus of spatial frequencies where both
are sensitive. For example, a Parkes observation will sample spatial frequencies
from 0 to near 64&nbsp;meters, and a ATCA mosaic (assuming the shortest ATCA
spacing is observed) will be sensitive from about 20&nbsp;meters upwards. As the
reliability of the data near the extremes is suspect,
spatial frequencies from 25 to 40&nbsp;meters should be modestly reliably represented
in both an ATCA mosaic and a Parkes image. Comparing in the overlap
annulus works very well when there is a simple source which is
well represented in this region (e.g. a dominant point source).

<P>
The tasks to perform the linear and non-linear combination both have parameters
for setting <EM>and</EM> deducing the flux calibration factor.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Point-spread function: In principle, knowing the point-spread function
(the ``beam'') of the single-dish image is just as important as it is for 
the mosaic.
It is best to `map' this at the time of the single-dish observations and to
account for any change in the beam that is caused by the single-dish imaging
process.

<P>
While it is possible to imagine algorithms that could deduce the
beamwidth based on the spatial frequency overlap between the single-dish
and mosaic data, in practise this is not possible (the overlap region
is not wide nor is the data reliable enough). In estimating beamwidth
parameters, the beamwidth and flux calibration factor are highly
coupled; an error in the beamwidth has much the same effect in the overlap region as
an error in the flux scale. Thus you cannot determine the beamwidth and flux
scale simultaneously.

<P>
The linear combination method assumes the single-dish point-spread
function is a gaussian form, whereas the non-linear method
takes a image dataset as the point-spread function (the point-spread
function need not be symmetric). If a point-spread function is not
readily available for the non-linear method, a gaussian dataset can be
produced.
