Self-Calibration
</H1>

<P>
Because the basic interpolated calibrator gains do not
determine the antenna gains perfectly at each time stamp, the quality of the
resultant image suffers.  Often the technique of self-calibration is
used to make additional corrections to the antenna gains as a function of time.
It is notionally very similar to the basic calibration. The main
difference is than the model of the source is generally more complex
than just
assuming its a point source at the phase centre.
The self-calibration technique finds antenna gains, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG

Like basic calibration, these gains are normally described as `antenna gains'.
This, however, is somewhat of a misnomer when a telescope measures dual
polarisations. In this case, it would be better to describe the gains as
`feed gains', as the gain factors will generally differ between the two
antenna feeds. The above equation should include subscripts to indicate the
polarisation type of the correlation (<I>e.g.</I> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="37" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img67.png"
 ALT="$V_{XX}$"></SPAN>) and the gain
(<I>e.g.</I> <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="24" HEIGHT="30" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img68.png"
 ALT="$g_{X}$"></SPAN>).

<P>
The model visibilities are generally derived from a model image (which should
have units of Jy/pixel). For a complex source, the model image will usually
be determined by the deconvolution tasks (the outputs of <A NAME="tex2html489"
  HREF="../doc/clean.html">clean</A>,
<A NAME="tex2html490"
  HREF="../doc/mfclean.html">mfclean</A>
or <A NAME="tex2html491"
  HREF="../doc/maxen.html">maxen</A>
<EM>without</EM> the restore step).
If the source is a point source, then a
point-source model could
be used, although the restriction that it be located at the phase centre
is lifted.

<P>
The self-calibration procedure is often performed iteratively, each time
with a better model, until finally the sequence converges and no
more improvement in the image quality can be made.

<P>
Self-calibration is not a technique that should be applied blindly.
This is especially true for ATCA data because, compared with the VLA, the
problem is only slightly over-determined.  This is because
the ATCA has, at most, 15 baselines to determine the complex gains for 6
antennas, whereas the VLA has, at most, 351 baselines to determine the
complex gains for 27 antennas. Because we can set the phase of one antenna
to zero, the problem reduces to finding
11 real numbers from 30 real equations.  With the 5-antenna compact
array, we must find 9 real numbers from 20 real equations.  This problem
is exacerbated when one antenna is absent from the data for a period
of time, or you have flagged it out because of poor data quality.

<P>
There are other problems to do with the east-west nature of the ATCA  - see
Bob Sault's technical memo <A NAME="tex2html492"
  HREF="http://www.atnf.csiro.au/observers/memos/d96f87~1.pdf">`Some simulations of
self-calibration for the AT'</A>
(AT Memo 39.3/058).
One important point to keep in mind is that
self-calibration with the ATCA  depends  crucially on the initial
model that you start with - much more so than with the VLA where you can
start with quite a poor model but arrive at the correct result after
just a few iterations.

<P>
Self-calibration, like basic calibration, requires that the
signal-to-noise ratio on each baseline be of the order of at least 5 or
so.  For weak sources, this may require a long solution interval, within
which the gains are assumed to be constant.
If, in reality, the gains are changing on a time-scale significantly
shorter than your solution interval, and these changes are degrading
your image quality, then you will be unable to improve the image
quality.  The time-scale on which you will often find it necessary to
correct the gains is approximately one minute.  Thus, weak sources often
cannot be self-calibrated. For a continuum observation (100 MHz bandwidth)
with the ATCA, you will, typically, need a signal strength of 100 mJy
before self-calibration is possible.

<P>
Note that it is not the receivers that cause the gains to be unsteady
with time, but the atmosphere.  In a similar way to the degradation of
an optical image by the atmosphere, a radio image is defocused by the
phase (and amplitude) noise that atmospheric cells induce into the
wavefront. Self-calibration can be thought of as an off-line mimicry of
adaptive optics in optical astronomy.
